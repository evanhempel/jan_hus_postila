Reading 3  
THE READING FOR THE THIRD SUNDAY OF ADVENT  
Saint Matthew, chapter 11, verses 2–10  

“At that time, when John heard in prison about the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples and said to him [to Jesus], ‘Are you the one who is to come [to redeem], or are we to look for another?’ And Jesus answered them, ‘Go and report to John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight [being healed], the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor are having the word of God preached to them [*evangelisantur*, that is: they hear the word of God and are helped by it]; and blessed is the one who is not scandalized [does not fall into unbelief] because of me.’  

And as they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: ‘What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind [that is: not a man driven by pride or instability]? But what then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft [clothes]? [Yet he goes about in rough camel’s hair!] Behold, those who wear soft [clothes] are in kings’ houses [as the proud and pleasure‑loving]. But what then did you go out to see? A prophet? Truly, I say to you, more than a prophet; this is he of whom it is written [Malachi the prophet writes, 3:1]: ‘Behold, I send my angel [that is: my messenger; *angelus* in Greek, messenger in our tongue] before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’”  

In this reading there is mention, first, of the imprisonment of Saint John, the Baptist of Christ; second, of the wondrous works of the Lord Jesus Christ; and third,  
A. of the praise of Saint John.  

About the imprisonment the reading says: “When John heard in chains about the works of Christ…” Know, then, that Saint John was in chains, in prison, because he rebuked King Herod for adultery, as Saint Matthew writes in chapter 14, verses 3–4: “Herod seized John, bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother’s wife; for John said to him, ‘It is not lawful for you to have her.’”  

And Saint Mark says in chapter 6, verse 20: “Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe; and when he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly.” Why was that? Saint John Chrysostom explains this in his sermon about Saint John: “The Baptist,” he says, “spoke what belonged to the law, what was just, what led to salvation; indeed, he spoke not what led to hatred, but what led to love.” Again he says: “John warned Herod by holy admonitions, not by accusations, as one who loved chastity, wanting him to be saved and not condemned.”  

But because few are willing to give up fornication, therefore Herod, not wanting to abandon his fornication and leave the adulterous harlot, bound John and threw him into prison. And there, being in chains, when he heard of the works of Christ, he sent his disciples to Christ. Therefore the reading says: “When John heard in prison about the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples and said to him, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or are we to look for another?’”  

Know here that Saint John did *not* doubt whether Christ was the one who had come to take away the sins of the world. For he had already confessed this, saying (John 1:29): “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” He had recognized him already while still in his mother’s womb and rejoiced; and when he baptized him he heard the testimony from God the Father that this is his beloved Son, whom we are to listen to.  

But John asked for the sake of his disciples and for other people, so that they would not doubt about Christ, but believe in him, listen to him, and in the end follow him. For that reason he instructed his disciples to question Christ, saying: “Are you the one who is to come as the promised Redeemer, or are we to look for another?”  

The reading continues: “And Jesus answered them, ‘Go and tell John what you hear and see.’” For as Saint Luke writes in chapter 7, verse 21, “In that very hour he healed many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and on many who were blind he bestowed sight.” And answering, he said to them: “Go and tell John what you have heard in my preaching and what you have seen in my wondrous deeds.”  

Here Saint Ambrose says: “The Lord prefers to answer by his deeds rather than by his words.” And Saint Jerome says: “Let words be silent; let deeds speak.” In this way the gracious Savior gave instruction, not to John, but to John’s disciples, so that they would believe that he is the one they were awaiting, who was to come to take away sins and free them from damnation. And to show that he is indeed that one, after he had healed many he said: “The blind receive their sight,” and so on.  

B. Know that by “the blind” are signified those who sin out of ignorance; by “the lame,” those who live partly badly and partly well; by “lepers,” those who sin out of great desire and passion; by “the deaf,” those who are hardened in malice; and by “the dead,” those who sin out of long‑rooted habit.  

All these now, by the grace of our Savior, can be healed, and many already are healed. So that those who sinned out of ignorance now see—recognizing what sin is and how they were blinded by it. Those who were lame—living now well, now badly—now live steadfastly in what is good. The lepers, defiled by sin through desire, are now cleansed. The deaf, who were indifferent to the word of God, now gladly listen to it. And the dead—that is, those who were dead in their souls through mortal sin and who sinned by long habit—these are now rising up out of that habit.  

And in these five spiritual healings there is a greater miracle than in bodily healings, and a greater grace of God than in those. Then the beloved Savior adds a sixth miracle, saying: “The poor have good news preached to them”—in Latin *evangelisantur*: that is, they feed on the reading and hearing of the word of God, and thus benefit both themselves and others; they hear it themselves and teach others.  

“The poor” means the humble in spirit; *they* are the ones who profit from the word of God.  

C. Know that through the preaching of the word of God, the understanding is enlightened; desire is rightly ordered; evil craving is quenched; hardness in wickedness is broken; sin is driven out; and the grace of God is brought forth in a person.  

From this you must realize: whoever, hearing the word of God, does not feel *any* one of these six gains in himself, carries a sign that he listens to the word of God without benefit.  

About the blessed poor in spirit, to whom the Savior is sent to preach, he himself says through Isaiah (Is. 61:1–2; cf. Luke 4:18–19): “He has sent me to bring good news to the meek, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”  

D. Further, in the reading the Savior says: “And blessed is the one who is not scandalized because of me!” Know here that people are offended and take scandal at Christ in many different ways.  

Some are offended at his mercy, saying that he does not punish when he ought to punish, or that he punishes when he ought not to punish. About the first they say, as Habakkuk says in chapter 1, verse 13: “Why do you look on those who deal treacherously?”—that is: why do you not avenge? About the second, that lazy servant said (Matthew 25:24): “I knew you to be a harsh man!”  

Some are offended at his wisdom, thinking that he does something he ought not to do—like those who rail against the weather, or those who imagine they could have devised things better than God has ordered them. They marvel that it goes well with the wicked, and say with Jeremiah (Jer. 12:1–2, alluded in the text as ch. 15): “Why does the way of the wicked prosper?”—that is: why are things going according to the will of the wicked?  

Some are offended because they do not want to suffer with him—like his disciples who stumbled, to whom he said (Matthew 26:31): “You will all fall away because of me this night.”  

Some are offended at his poverty—especially priests in general, who do not want to be voluntarily poor. So that young man also took offense and went away sad, when Christ said to him (Matthew 19:21): “Go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and come, follow me.”  

Some are offended at his words, saying with the Jews (John 6:60): “This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?” Thus all who do not keep his commandments are offended at his teaching, thinking it too hard. And in general, whoever does not believe in him and in what he has commanded, and does not fulfill it, is offended at Christ.  

Therefore blessed is the one who does *not* in the end take scandal because of him. For although many have stumbled, yet afterward, turning back again, by his grace they have been corrected.  

E. Next the reading says: “As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: ‘What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?’” As if to say: Do you think John was like a reed, empty inside, without the grace of God? Do you imagine that flattery moved him when he sent to me, or inconstancy, because he had first borne witness to me, saying (John 1:29), “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world,” and now says, “Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?”  

Know that he did *not* depart from his earlier testimony like a reed that bends before the wind.  

Here Saint Gregory speaks in this way: “A reed is immediately bent to one side as soon as the wind touches it.” And what is meant by the reed? Bodily desire—this is what, as soon as the breeze of favor or of insult touches it, is quickly bent aside. When the little wind of favor blows, it rejoices, boasts, and wholly turns itself toward favor; but when the little wind of insult blows from the same quarter from which the breeze of praise had come, then at once it turns itself to anger.  

But John was not a reed shaken by the wind. Neither did the favor of praise make him into a flatterer; nor did anyone’s anger make him cruel; nor did prosperity lift him up into pride; nor did adversity cast him down from virtue. Therefore he was not a reed shaken by the wind, for no changeable thing moved him from the uprightness of his state.  

Therefore, dearest ones, let us learn not to be reeds shaken by the wind. Let us make our intention firm, set amid the shifting winds of human tongues. Let the state of our mind stand unmoved; let no insult stir us to anger; let no unsteady favor bend us toward favor‑seeking; let adversity not make us bitter—  
so that we, who are firmly set in the constancy of faith, may not be moved by the inconstant things of this world. So far Saint Gregory.  

In short: do not let yourself be moved by flattery to pride, nor by insults to anger, nor by prosperity to the sins of pride or sensual pleasure, nor by adversities—such as poverty or other troubles—to impatience. If you stand firm in this, then you will not be a reed shaken by the wind, and you will be worthy that Christ should praise you, as he praised Saint John.  

F. Christ goes on: “But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing?” As if he said: John is no flatterer. For if he had wanted to flatter, he would not have lived in the wilderness, nor would he now be clothed in rough haircloth, sitting in Herod’s prison. If he had wanted to flatter, then he would have flattered kings, not me, who am poor. For those who want to go in soft and fine clothing—*they* are in kings’ houses, flattering them.  

Oh, how many flatterers there are, especially priests, in the courts of princes, of kings and lords, and especially in the court of the pope! To him the greatest flatterers creep, and worship and bow more than to the Lord God. And all this they do so that they may go in soft and costly garments, and bring forth pride, pleasure, and greed! Such people have surely wandered very far from the life of John!  

And woe to us, who do not want to suffer, and yet, living softly, want to be saved! Woe to those who wear proud clothing for the sake of display; who have it cut in strange ways; who possess much of it, which moths consume as much or more than they do!  

Saint James the apostle threatens such people, saying (James 5:1–3): “Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you. Your riches have rotted, and your garments are moth‑eaten. Your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire!”  

Wise people, remembering this, do not seek much costly clothing, but use such garments as are enough to cover their shame, drive away cold, and provide the body what it truly needs. For for these reasons clothing was given by God to Eve and Adam when they had sinned: he gave them a wreath of leaves to cover shame and a coat of skins to protect them from the cold.  

Behold, John wore a rough garment of hair, by which he put away both shame and cold; therefore the Savior praises him that he does not go in soft raiment.  

The reading continues: “But what then did you go out to see? A prophet?” As if he said: John is not silent out of envy, as if he wished to be called a prophet greater than I. “Truly, I say to you,” Christ says, “[he is] more than a prophet; for this is he of whom it is written: ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face.’”  

These words are the words of God the Father to the Son. For God the Father sent John before Christ his Son, so that John would first preach, first baptize, and first die for preaching—and thus prepare the way for the people, so that they might recognize Christ and believe in him.  

Therefore John said to the priests from Jerusalem (John 1:26–27): “I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know, he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”  

Thus John was sent by God to go before Christ according to his humanity: to preach first, to baptize first, and first to make the way ready for the people. And this way is the way of Christ, on which he came after John: to baptize us, to free us from our sins, and finally—if we are good—to give us, by his grace, eternal life.
