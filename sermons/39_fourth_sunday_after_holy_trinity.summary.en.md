title: Fourth Sunday After Holy Trinity
---

This is a summary of Jan Hus' sermon for the Fourth Sunday after Holy Trinity, based on Luke 6:36-42. The sermon focuses on mercy, judgment, and hypocrisy, urging believers to imitate God's mercy and avoid unjust judgment.

### Key Points:
- **God’s Mercy as Model**: Hus emphasizes that believers must be merciful as God is merciful, defining mercy as the will to help the needy.
  - Mercy includes both spiritual acts (teaching, comforting) and physical acts (feeding, clothing).
  - God values the intention behind giving, not the amount (e.g., the widow’s mite in Mark 12:41-44).
- **Warning Against Judgment**: 
  - Hus warns against rashly judging others, especially when their actions could have good intentions.
  - Only God knows the heart; humans should presume the best and avoid condemning others (Matthew 7:1-2).
- **Forgiveness and Generosity**:
  - Forgiveness leads to being forgiven (Luke 6:37). 
  - Generosity will be rewarded by God with "good measure, pressed down, shaken together" (Luke 6:38).
- **Hypocrisy and Leadership**:
  - Leaders (especially clergy) must not be "blind guides" (Luke 6:39), as they risk leading others into sin.
  - Before correcting others, one must first address their own sins ("remove the plank from your own eye," Luke 6:42).
- **Spiritual vs. Physical Blindness**: 
  - Spiritual blindness (lack of understanding) is worse than physical blindness and disqualifies one from leadership.

### Key Quote:
> "Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful. Judge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven." (Luke 6:36-37)
