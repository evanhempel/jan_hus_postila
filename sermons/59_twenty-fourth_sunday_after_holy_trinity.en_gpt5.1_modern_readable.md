# Twenty-Fourth Sunday After Holy Trinity

Saint Matthew writes in chapter 9, verses 18–22:

At that time, while Jesus was speaking to the crowds, a certain ruler came up and bowed before Him, saying, “Lord, my daughter has just now died. Come, lay Your hand on her, and she will live.” Jesus got up and went with him, and so did His disciples. And look, a woman who had suffered bleeding for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the edge of His cloak. For she said to herself, “If I only touch His cloak, I will be healed.” Jesus turned, saw her, and said, “Take courage, daughter; your faith has made you well.” And the woman was healed at that very hour.

This reading tells us about our Savior: how He preached to the crowds, healed a woman from a disease of constant bleeding, and raised the daughter of a certain ruler from the dead. In these acts He shows His eagerness for our salvation, His mercy, His power, and His wisdom.

The reading says: “While Jesus was speaking to the crowds”—that is, in truth, He was answering John the Baptist’s disciples, explaining why His disciples did not fast—“look, a certain ruler came.” This was the leader of the Jewish synagogue, the one by whose command the Jews gathered in the house of worship. Saint Mark tells us his name: he was called Jairus (Mark 5:22). “He came up,” that is, humbly, “to Jesus and pleaded with Him.” Saint Luke says (Luke 8:41) that he begged Him, falling at His feet, and said, “Lord, my daughter has just now died.”

Saint Mark (5:23) writes that she was at the point of death; Saint Luke (8:42) says she was dying. They all speak truth, because she was right at the edge of death, and she did die. So her father spoke as Matthew records—that she had “just now died”—for they had already come and told him that she was dead. As Luke writes (Luke 8:49), someone came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house and said to him, “Your daughter has died; do not trouble the Teacher any more.” The ruler took up that report and said, “Lord, my daughter has just now died; therefore come, lay Your hand on her, and she will live.”

In Latin it says *sed veni*. The word *sed* usually means “but,” yet here it fits better to take it as “therefore, come”: “Therefore, since she has now died, come and lay Your hand on her.” If you still want to say “but,” then you must understand it this way: “Lord, my little daughter has just now died; but”—listen—“I trust in You. Only come, lay Your hand on her, and she will live.”

This ruler did not have full faith, just as that royal official did not, whom Christ rebuked for unbelief, saying (John 4:48), “Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.” He said that because the man wanted Christ to come physically to his house, saying (John 4:49), “Lord, come down before my son dies.” As I have already written about him, he did not truly believe that Christ, as God, is present everywhere, nor that He could heal his son unless He was physically standing there. In the same way this ruler says: “Come, lay Your hand on her, and she will live.”

That this ruler did not fully believe is shown by this: he did not speak like the centurion, who said (Matthew 8:8), “Lord, just say the word, and my servant will be healed”—and so he might have said, “and my daughter will live.” That is why Luke tells us (Luke 8:50), “Jesus said to him, ‘Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be healed.’”

The reading continues: “Jesus got up and went with him, and so did His disciples.” Saint Remigius notes how wonderful is the humility and gentleness of our Lord in this. You will not easily find a pope who, together with his cardinals, will quickly hurry to a sick person the way our Savior here goes at once with this ruler, together with His disciples!

“And look, a woman”—Christ knows exactly who she was, though I do not—“who had suffered from a flow of blood for twelve years.” Saint Ambrose thinks she may have been Martha, the sister of Mary Magdalene, for he says in one of his books: “Christ, so generous, dried up the flow of blood in Martha and cast out devils from Mary.” That is Ambrose. But Eusebius says, *In scol. hist. lib. 7, cap. 14*, that she was a citizen from a town called Caesarea Philippi. Whether that is she or not, Christ healed this woman, of whom Matthew marvels, saying: “Look, a woman who had suffered bleeding”—that is, she had a constant issue of blood—“for twelve years.”

Saint Luke writes (Luke 8:43) that she had spent all she had on physicians and could not be healed by any of them. From that, when Luke says she had spent all her wealth on doctors, it is very likely she was not Martha, for Martha and Lazarus had plenty of property in Bethany. She had endured this disease for twelve years, and no doctor could help her. That shows how great her sickness was. And especially, her healing was reserved for the glory of Jesus and for the healing of her soul—and of many others.

The reading goes on: she “came up behind Him and touched the edge of His cloak.” She came from behind, not because she wanted to “steal” a touch secretly from Christ, but because at first she could not get to Him through the crowd; therefore she touched Him from behind. Afterward, as Mark says (Mark 5:33), “fearing and trembling, she came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth.”

And to see what kind of faith she had, listen: the reading says, “For she said to herself”—that is, she firmly settled it in her mind—“If I only touch His cloak, I will be healed.” Saint John Chrysostom says: “This woman believed more truly—more strongly—than the Jewish ruler. For the ruler brought doctors, but she thought it enough just to touch the edge of His cloak.” Thus Chrysostom.

Perhaps our Savior healed this woman on the way precisely to strengthen the ruler’s faith and also to show that this woman had greater faith than that ruler. And by healing her on the road, He gave us an example: that even on the way, wherever we can, we should do good to our neighbor.

It also strikes me as a very notable thing that Saint Mark writes (Mark 5:26): this woman “had suffered much under many physicians, had spent all she had, and it had done her no good; in fact, she had grown worse.” That is Mark. Yet see this: the moment she eagerly touched just the hem of Christ’s garment, the blood stopped, and she was healed.

In the same way, many people spend large sums of money on “spiritual doctors” to have them absolve them, to stop the “blood” of their sins and heal their souls—and it does them no true good, and they become worse. But when they touch the “hem” of Christ—that is, His humanity—with a devout heart, believing that Christ’s humanity, which is lower than His divinity, will stop the flow of their blood—that is, the stream of their sins—and heal them, then they are helped. They cry out with David (Psalm 51:16): “Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my salvation!” David was delivered from “blood” by God through the humanity of Christ, when by Christ’s death he was redeemed from sin.

The reading continues: “Jesus turned around.” Mark says (Mark 5:30–32), “Turning around in the crowd, He said, ‘Who touched My clothes?’ His disciples said to Him, ‘You see the crowd pressing in on You, and You ask, “Who touched Me?”’ And He looked around to see who had done it.”

O merciful Savior! The crowd is pressing You, and the sick woman is touching You, and You bear it all so gently! I cannot help thinking that Your “vicars” today would not endure it so patiently. From some of them the poor and the sick are driven away with blows and sticks!

O dear Christ! Why did You turn around? Why do You ask, “Who touched My garment?” Why do You look around to see this woman? You, who are God from eternity, You knew who would touch You, and how, and with what intention. We know this, merciful Jesus, good Physician: that this woman, with great desire and true faith, touched Your mercy and Your power more than she touched the edge of Your cloak. Therefore, in order to show her Your mercy and make Your holy power known to Your people, You turned toward the crowd and looked around, so You might see this bleeding woman with merciful eyes and give a sign that You were kindly disposed toward her.

So Your own evangelist Matthew testifies, as he goes on in the reading: “Jesus turned, and seeing her, said, ‘Take courage, daughter; your faith has made you well.’”

O woman, what have you done to deserve this—that Jesus, God, the true King above all kings, the most worthy Bishop, without whom nothing good can be done, the Savior of the elect—turns kindly toward you, a bleeding woman, looks upon you, and says to you, “Take courage, daughter”! O woman, Jesus is now strengthening you, saying, “Take courage.” He calls you “daughter.” The Savior is not ashamed of you in front of the crowd, that He should have such a poor, sick daughter!

Look—He calls you His daughter, and not falsely but truly. For He created you; He redeemed you by His blood; He poured out His blood on the cross. I mean the blood from which men are also called “bloody”—the blood of ugly sin. And beyond that, He has stopped in you the flow of bodily blood; and even more, He has made you His daughter in His grace. Therefore He rightly calls you “daughter.”

O bleeding woman, how gladly you must have heard the King and Savior of the world say to you, “Take courage, daughter; your faith has made you well!” Look—He calls you His daughter, He praises your faith, and He gives you healing. And as Luke records, He also said to you (Luke 8:48), “Go in peace.” The King of peace has given you peace—the One who came to reconcile man with God, man with the angel, and man with man. He said to you, “Go in peace!” Before this, you were in unrest with the doctors because of your disease. Now, go in peace, healed in body. Before this, you had unrest because of sin. Now, go in peace, being at peace with God—for it is your faith that has healed you.

O Christ, was it not You who healed her, when You say, “Your faith has made you well”? How could faith heal her if You Yourself had not healed her? Surely it is You who, because of her faith, healed her by Your power out of Your grace. Yet You do not say, “I have healed you,” so that You might teach us to avoid boasting—since even when You do good through us, we boast emptily; and sometimes, when we have done nothing good at all, we still hunger for praise.

And in saying, “Your faith has made you well,” You confirm the woman in her faith, so that she might value that faith highly within herself. You also give us instruction, that we too should believe firmly, and by faith receive healing for our souls, just as this woman received it. Of her the reading further says: “And the woman was healed at that very hour.”

She was healed when she touched the hem of His garment, as Luke writes (Luke 8:44): “She came up behind Him and touched the edge of His cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.” There you hear when she was healed—when she touched Him. And because she was afraid, the Healer held out hope to her, saying, “Take courage, daughter.” You are touching the garment of your merciful Father; do not be afraid—“your faith has made you well.”

O dear Savior, why did You make this woman known in front of the crowd? Did You shame her by announcing her disease to everyone? You have done all things well; I do not know how I could blame You. You brought her into the open, first, so that she who came secretly would be corrected and understand that she could do nothing without Your knowing it. Second, so that her faith would be made known to all. Third, so that Your power would be proclaimed. Fourth, so that You might lead the Jewish ruler into a deeper faith. And You know other reasons, Savior, for which You did not disgrace this bleeding woman, but instead showed her to be precious in faith, saying, “Take courage, daughter; your faith has made you well.”

Grant, merciful Savior, Your grace to us, that by true faith we may be healed in our souls.
