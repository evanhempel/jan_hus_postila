title: Third Sunday After Holy Trinity
---

This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon for the Third Sunday after Holy Trinity, based on Luke 15:1-10. Hus emphasizes Christ's mercy toward sinners, the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, and the joy in heaven over repentant sinners.

### Key Points:
- **Christ's Mercy**: 
  - Jesus welcomes both public and secret sinners, teaching and eating with them (Luke 15:1-2).
  - He defends them against the accusations of the scribes and Pharisees.
- **Pharisees' Hypocrisy**: 
  - They criticize Jesus for associating with sinners, revealing their pride and self-righteousness.
  - Their judgment stems from unbelief and envy (Luke 15:2).
- **Parables of Lost Sheep and Coin**: 
  1. **Lost Sheep (Luke 15:4-7)**:
     - A shepherd leaves 99 sheep to find one lost sheep, symbolizing Christ's pursuit of sinners.
     - Greater joy in heaven over one repentant sinner than over 99 righteous.
  2. **Lost Coin (Luke 15:8-10)**:
     - A woman searches diligently for a lost coin, representing God's wisdom seeking lost humanity.
     - Angels rejoice over one sinner who repents.
- **Repentance**: 
  - True repentance involves sorrow for sin, turning from it, and enduring trials (Luke 13:5).
  - It is a command for salvation (Matthew 4:17).

### Key Quote:
> "Pravi vám, že tak radost bude v nebi nad jedniem hřiešníkem pokánie činícím, než nad devadesáti a devieti spravedlivými, jenž nepotřěbují pokánie."  
> ("I say to you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance." — Luke 15:7)
