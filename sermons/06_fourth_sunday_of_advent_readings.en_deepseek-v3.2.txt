### READING FOR THE FOURTH SUNDAY IN ADVENT.
St. John writes in the 1st chapter, verses 19-26.
At that time the Jews from Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to John, to ask him (saying: Who are you? And he confessed (that he is not Christ] and did not deny (what he was]; and he confessed, saying: I am not Christ. And they asked him: What (are you] then? Are you Elijah? And he answered: I am not (that Elijah in person, as you think]! Are you the Prophet? And he answered: Nothing (i.e., I am not that prophet, as you mean]! Then they said to him: Who are you? so that we may give an answer to those who sent us; what do you say about yourself? He says: I am the voice of one crying (for Christ] in the wilderness (of this world]: make straight [with good deeds] the way of the Lord (God], as says Isaiah the prophet [in chapter 40, verse 3]. And those who were sent were from among the scribes (who are most opposed to the truth against (their] will]; and they asked him and said to him: Why then do you baptize, since you are not Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet? John answered them, saying: I baptize with water [that is, I wash with water], but among you stands (and dwells both according to divinity and humanity] the one whom you do not know (to be God and Christ]; he is the one who will come after me (to baptize with the Holy Spirit], the one who was made before me. [in dignity more worthy in humanity], whose sandal strap I am not worthy to untie (he had sandals). These things happened in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
This holy reading shows the goodness of Saint John and the wickedness of the priests and scribes, and thus teaches faithful Christians to follow in the goodness of Saint John, and to not fall into the wickedness of the priests. John's goodness shows itself in the confession of truth and in humility: he confessed the truth, telling what he was not, and did not deny what he was; he showed humility, saying: I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness! The wickedness of the priests, who sent and were sent, shows itself in this, that they hated the life of Saint John, as the reading testifies; for they say: "Why then do you baptize?" And our Savior says in chapter 11, verse 18 of St. Matthew: John came neither eating, i.e., meat, nor drinking, namely wine, and they say: He has a devil! namely in himself.

Second, their wickedness shows itself, that they do not want to be satisfied with a good answer, but press, saying: "Why then do you baptize, since you are not Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?" Oh, what wickedness do present-day priests have, who call others, who are living well, devil-possessed! For when they call them heretics and erroneous, then in this they hold them for devil-possessed. And this our faithful Savior prophesied in chapter 10, verse 25 of St. Matthew, saying: Since they call the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household. And just as they forbade John to baptize, saying: Why then do you baptize? so present-day (priests) forbid both to preach and to baptize and to serve mass to those who lead (people) in God's truth. They themselves do not preach the straightforward truth, so that people would leave off sins, and they forbid others; just as those priests did not preach God's law, and they forbade Christ, stopping his mouth, as St. Luke 11:53 testifies, and cursing those who believed in him, as St. John 9:28 testifies. So also present-day (priests) do, sending their messengers both from Rome and from Prague, and procuring bulls to stop preaching in the chapels and to burn books; as happened under Archbishop Zbyněk, and now happens in the disturbances of the Prague Archbishopric. Alas! They do not heed that God says in this reading: Make straight the way of God! John made straight, he himself lived well, showed others the way to salvation, rebuked sins, and showed by his preaching how they ought to live; therefore he also said: "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, make straight the way of God!"
Here we must note that Saint John humbly confessed his frailty, saying: "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness," that is: I am a call from him who cries in the wilderness. And so understand, that Saint John is God's herald, preaching in the wilderness and calling people to repentance, saying in Luke chapter 3, verse 8: Bear fruits worthy of repentance, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. And this calling is done by God, who calls to repentance; God calls man through every creature, as St. Augustine says in Book 11 of the Confessions: Heaven and earth and all things which are in heaven and on earth, behold, everywhere they tell me to love you, nor do they cease telling all people, so that they cannot have an excuse, that they did not love God. Second, God calls in the wilderness of this world, that every man is very frail; therefore he said to Isaiah in chapter 40, verse 6: Cry! And Isaiah: What shall I cry? And God to him: All flesh is grass, and all its glory like the flower of the field! Solomon, having perceived this, being deceived by the vanity of the world, also says in Ecclesiastes, last chapter, 12:8: Vanity of vanities, and all things are vanity! that is: man, who gives himself to any things whatsoever, having forsaken God, will find for himself nothing but vanity; for the comfort of all things will perish for him. Therefore it is necessary for man to diligently serve God, and to use the things which the Lord God has given him for nothing else than for His praise and for his own salvation; and thus he should first know himself: who is he? what is he like? where is he? and where will he be? Who? That he is a man created by God and redeemed by His blood; and what is he like? That because of sins he is wretched and unstable in deeds; and where is he? That in a wretched world, which is a true wilderness, full of poisonous serpents, i.e., priests and other evil slanderers, to whom Saint John and Christ said that they are a brood of vipers. And where will he be? Woe if he falls into the eternal fire!
And indeed, if a man often looked into himself and knew himself, then he could also know God, and many other things for his own benefit. Therefore the wise men had written above the entrance of their school this saying: "Know thyself!" so that whoever wishes to know wisdom, would first begin from himself; for he who does not rightly know himself, how can he know other things? Saint John, knowing himself, what he is, humbly confessed that he is the voice of one crying in the wilderness; and he knew and declared the dignity of the Savior, saying: "I baptize with water," showing, that he after me will baptize; but among you he is, both as God, and also as man, whom you for your sin and for not knowing the prophecies do not know. He is, who after me will come to baptize, preach and teach, as after me he began to be in life according to humanity, and after me he was born; that one, who was made before me: not according to divinity made, nor according to humanity first created, but that one, who before me and before every man in dignity is first.
Here remember, that Christ in divinity is not made, and that as a man he was made after Saint John, and yet in dignity he is the first made: And this dignity John confesses, saying: "Whose sandal strap I am not worthy to untie." As if he said: And what wonder is it, that this one more worthy than I is, whom I know, that he was born after me, but the mystery of his birth I do not fully know? Thus says St. Gregory In Om. And so through the strap, by which the sandal is fastened to the foot, is understood the union of Christ's humanity with divinity; for the Son of God took upon himself humanity by this likeness, that just as first is the foot, and remaining a foot it takes upon itself a sandal and will be hidden under the sandal: so also the divinity in the person of the Son of God took upon itself humanity and remained divinity, hidden from bodily eyes under the humanity. And this union of divinity with humanity John is not worthy to untie, as he says, humbly confessing his lack of skill in this: I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal.
From this speech the black-robed brother monks argue against the barefoot friars that Christ walked in shoes like them, saying, that John would not have spoken of his sandals thus, if he did not have them; and the barefoot ones in turn against them say that Christ walked barefoot like them, for otherwise at the feast Mary Magdalene could not have washed his feet with her tears. But in this dispute neither they nor these have a good argument, but sin remains for both of them, that they do not want to follow Christ poor without desire for possessions, and thus having an excessive desire for possessions, both have not shod their feet; but Christ, who underwent poverty for us, in mind was shod from desire for temporal possessions, and if he willed, then sometimes he walked in sandals and sometimes barefoot. And this I must not untie, whether he ever walked in sandals, or never walked; but I have enough on this, that for me, a sinner, he walked in the world, as he willed.
