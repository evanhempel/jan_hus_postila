# Fifteenth Sunday After Holy Trinity  
Matthew 6:24–33

At that time Jesus said:

“No one can serve two masters who pull in opposite directions.  
Either he’ll end up hating one and loving the other,  
or he’ll hold on to one and look down on the other.  
You cannot serve God and *mammonae* — money, possessions.”

“That’s why I tell you: don’t worry about your life, about what you’ll eat,  
or about your body, what you’ll wear.  
Isn’t life worth more than food, and the body more than clothes?

Look at the birds of the sky. They don’t plant or harvest or store things in barns,  
yet your Father in heaven feeds them.  
Aren’t you worth far more than they are?

And which of you, by worrying, can add a single step to your height  
or a single moment to your life?

And why are you so anxious about clothes?  
Look carefully at the lilies of the field — the wildflowers — how they grow.  
They don’t work, they don’t spin thread,  
yet I’m telling you: not even Solomon, that powerful, wise, and wealthy king,  
in all his royal splendor, was dressed like one of them.

So if God so beautifully clothes the grass of the field,  
which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire,  
won’t he much more clothe you — you of little faith?

So then, don’t be anxious, saying,  
‘What are we going to eat?’  
or ‘What are we going to drink?’  
or ‘What will we wear?’  
People who don’t know God run after all these things.

Your heavenly Father certainly knows that you need all of them.  
But you — seek first the kingdom of God, the joy of heaven,  
and his righteousness — every virtue that leads there —  
and all these things you need for this life  
will be added to you in due measure.”

Our merciful Savior, through this holy teaching, is pulling his faithful people away from a wrong love of earthly things and drawing them toward the love of heavenly things.

In this passage he does three things:

1. First, he commands us not to serve wealth.  
2. Second, he warns us not to pour uncontrolled effort into bodily things.  
3. Third, he calls us to trust the heavenly Father and to seek the kingdom of heaven *first*.

Even though our Savior has given us this very good, holy, and useful command for our salvation, Luke writes (Luke 16:14) that when the law-experts — who were greedy — heard this, they made fun of him.

Bede comments on that. He says:  
Earlier Christ had warned these teachers and legal experts not to put their trust in their own righteousness, but to receive sinners who turned back and to redeem their sins with alms.  
But they laughed at the very one who was commanding mercy, humility, and self-control!

So Luke rightly says: when the greedy law-experts heard this, they mocked him — and for two reasons.

1. Either they thought he was commanding them things that were completely useless,  
2. or they thought he was commanding them what they had already done completely — so his command was pointless.

Bede says this.

And the way things stand today with many “masters,” priests, and church lawyers is no better. They are not different from those men. Among them too this very passage is silently mocked.

In fact, today Christ is mocked even more than then:

- Those men at least openly rejected Christ’s teaching.  
- Many now reject it under a cover of religion. Some *say* they keep it, and others openly oppose him by their words and their way of life.  

Both groups kiss him at Mass, yet they refuse to let go of greed.

So they call themselves disciples of Christ, but in truth they follow Judas — Judas who heard this very teaching from Christ and still kissed him while betraying him for greed.

But not so Peter, and not the other apostles, nor their true followers.  
They threw away worldly power and greed.  
If they had something to eat and drink and decent clothes to work in, they were satisfied.  
They obeyed Christ in this passage:  
they sought the kingdom of heaven *first*.  
They lived well themselves, they taught others to do the same,  
and so they served one Lord — God — above all.

For he says:

> “No one can serve two masters.”


## Who Are These Two Masters?

Understand that Christ is speaking about *two masters who are opposed to each other* and about *real, ordered service*.  
No one can properly, rightly, and with their heart’s desire serve two masters who rule in opposite ways at the same time.

Christ himself gives the example:

> “You cannot serve God and money.”

Even the dullest thinking person can grasp this:  
you cannot at the same time bend the desire of your heart fully toward both God and money.

You’ve got to lean one way or the other. Either:

- your desire, with your inner agreement, leans more toward God than money,  
or  
- it leans more toward money than God.

And wherever your desire and choice lean more, *that* is where your service truly goes.

So:

- If the greater desire of your heart, with your consent, is toward God, then your service belongs to God, not to money.

- But if your desire leans more toward money than toward God, and therefore more toward comfort than salvation, then you’re serving money, not God.

Christ measures service by this intense desire.  
That’s why he says:

> “Don’t be anxious about your life, about what you’ll eat…”

There he forbids excessive desire.  

And when he says:

> “Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness,”

he commands us to have our greatest desire set on God —  
God, who is the joy of the chosen in his kingdom,  
and on righteousness — every virtue that leads to that kingdom.

So if you want to know whom you’re really serving, turn your mind inward and weigh this:  
Where is my greatest energy?  
Where does my desire most eagerly go?

You’ll see quickly whom you really serve.

Let me give an example:

Petr has two masters. If he serves Jan more eagerly and with more heartfelt desire than Přibík, then in truth Petr serves Jan more than Přibík.

Or Petr has two women he loves: Kateřina and Markéta.  
If his desire and effort are more eagerly turned to Kateřina than to Markéta, then he loves Kateřina more than Markéta.

So, you who are greedy — judge for yourself:  
Where does your desire, with the most effort, actually go?  
There is where your service truly lies.


## God and the Devil: Two Opposite Lords

It just doesn’t make sense that a person could rightly lean with more, or even equal, desire toward any created thing than toward God.

If he did, he would be valuing a creature above God in his heart.  
That’s already to treat God as less than the creature, to set him aside, even to hold him in contempt.

That’s why it’s impossible to serve God and money in a proper way at the same time.

So the Savior says:

> “You cannot serve God and money.”

And when he begins this reading, he says plainly:

> “No one can” — that is, rightly, truly, with loving desire —  
> “serve two masters” — that is, masters who are opposed in their rule.

These are always *two* kinds of masters who pull human desire in opposite directions.

God and the devil are such two masters: opposed, contrary, and never in harmony.

- God is the true Lord of the whole world, because he created it and sustains it.  
  He is especially Lord of humankind, because he created people,  
  bought them back with his own blood,  
  feeds them,  
  and will give them the kingdom of heaven — *if* they will truly serve him.  
  He alone is Lord over all other lords.

- The devil is *not* a true lord, but a thief and robber.  
  He has no rightful claim to rule over anyone.  
  Yet by his wickedness he pulls under himself whoever he can.  
  Scripture calls him “king over all the children of pride” (Job 40),  
  and Christ calls him “the prince of this world” — that is, of evil people living in this world.


## Which Master Are You Running After?

You’ll work hard and search diligently for some weak little human boss so you can fill your belly and get a bit of clothing.  
You go to him and ask eagerly:  
“What do you want me to do in your service?”

And that little boss can’t give you a thing unless the great Lord allows it.

My dear brother, be at least that diligent for the *best* Master,  
the most powerful, the richest, and the most generous.

- The *best* — he can’t do injustice, and he never gets angry without cause.  
- The *most powerful* — no one can overcome him; he can defend his servant against every enemy.  
- The *richest* — all things are in his hand.  
- And the *most generous* — no one can outgive him in rewarding his servants.

For he gives his servant the kingdom of heaven and joy so full that nothing greater can rightly be desired.

My dear brother,  
at your baptism you were given over to this Lord.  
So serve him with diligence.

He created you.  
He redeemed you with his own blood.  
He feeds you.  
He protects you from the devil.  
He nourishes you with his own body and gives you drink with his blood.  
He forgives the sins of those who turn back to him.  
He gives them virtues, strengthens them in good,  
helps them to carry it out,  
cheers their hearts,  
and where he himself is, there he wants his servant to be with him forever.

He is the most faithful and the best Master.  
To serve him, as Gregory says, *is to reign*.

Who, then, but a cursed fool would refuse to be diligent in serving such a Master?  
And his service is very light. It boils down to this:

- love this Lord above all,  
- and love your neighbor.

This service means:

- you choose not to commit sin,  
- and you choose to love what is good.

It’s a light service because a person can fulfill it and earn reward for it *anywhere*:

- in the open air,  
- at sea,  
- in prison,  
- in chains,  
- in poverty,  
- in sickness,  
- even naked.

As long as one soul is still in a body, that person can serve the Lord God in this way and receive, as a reward, the eternal kingdom — fullness of joy without lack.

How terrible that people neglect the service of this Lord  
and instead serve another master who opposes him — the devil:

- the poorest,  
- the worst,  
- the most cruel,  
- who makes his servants ugly and shameful,  
- strips them of virtues,  
- weakens them for good,  
- hardens them in evil,  
- kills their soul,  
- and then torments them forever in darkness and fire.

These are the two lords who oppose each other in their rule.  
You cannot serve them both at once.

So those people are deceived who refuse to keep God’s commandments yet imagine they can serve him with fasts, alms, prayers, or other outward works while at the same time — by mortal sin — they are serving the devil.

The Lord, who cannot lie, says:

> “No one can serve two masters.”

You cannot rightly, with your heart’s desire, at the same time serve two opposite lords, because:

> “He will hate one” — that is, the devil —  
> “and love the other” — that is, God.  
> “Or he will put up with the one” — the devil (Luke says: “cling to one”) —  
> “and despise the other” — God.

Both wordings are true.

The sinner may not say with his lips that he loves the devil more than God,  
but he *puts up with* the devil ruling him in evil,  
and by his sin he *clings* to the devil, as Luke says.

And he *despises* God, because anyone who commits mortal sin  
throws away God’s commandment, sins in pride, and treats God with contempt.

Augustine, in a sermon *In omel*, explains:

The Lord says “he will despise” and not “he will hate,” because no conscience can truly bear the thought that it hates God.  
But a person *despises* God when he does not fear him —  
when he does not keep his commandments.

That’s Augustine’s comment.


## Serving God or Serving Wealth?

Jesus then explains more clearly:

> “You cannot serve God and money.”

To serve wealth is to deny God.

In the Latin text it says *mammonae*.  
Jerome writes that in the Syrian language *mammona* means “wealth,”  
and that *Mammon* is also the name of a demon — the one who uses wealth to drag people into sin.

So it seems best to read it this way:

> “You cannot serve God and *mammonae* — that is, wealth.”

You can see this from Christ’s next words:

> “So I tell you, don’t be anxious about your life, what you’ll eat…”

Immediately he touches on food and clothing —  
two things on which all truly useful earthly possessions depend.

If a person has enough to eat and is kept warm,  
he ought to be satisfied.

So when the Savior forbids disordered excess in these two — food and clothing —  
he is certainly warning against excess in everything else.

To understand this reading better, notice two things:  
different kinds of service, and different kinds of care.


## Three Kinds of “Service”

First, there are three kinds of service.

1. **Natural service**  
   This every creature owes to God, whether it wants to or not.  
   All creation must serve its Creator.

2. **Loving service**  
   This is the service every person owes to every other,  
   and which we give when, living in God’s grace and doing good works,  
   we serve God and also serve the angels and all the saints —  
   in heaven, in the place of waiting, and here on earth.

3. **Human service**  
   This was invented by people, and it is often disordered.  
   And now, people mostly fight and scramble for this kind of service.

This human service gets established in three main ways:

- **By force and conquest** – one group subdues another and makes them serve.  
- **By free choice** – one person willingly places himself under another’s service for earthly pay.  
- **By personal limitation** – some people are naturally rough and better suited for physical work than others.  

In that third case it’s most reasonable that such a person would serve others who are better equipped in body and mind to lead.  
The philosopher Aristotle says that people who are gifted in understanding and reason are, by nature, lords and governors over others.


## Two Kinds of Good Care — and One Bad

Second, understand that there is good care and bad care.

**Good care** is again of two kinds.

1. **Purely spiritual care**  
   When a person eagerly and diligently focuses on God, on virtue, and on spiritual works.  
   This suits the contemplative life — what some call the spiritual life.  
   The apostles and their true followers had this care in a special way.

2. **Mixed care**  
   When, in an active working life, a person first looks to God, to virtue, and to good works,  
   and then carries out bodily work as well.  

   - This was Martha’s care — she was busy about serving Jesus and his disciples something to eat.  
   - This was Mary Magdalene’s higher care — she left bodily work, sat at Jesus’ feet, and listened carefully to his words.

   Martha’s care was good, but troubled. She got upset in her serving.  
   So the Savior told her (Luke 10:41):

   > “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.”

Beyond these two, *every other kind of care is bad*,  
when a person cares more about a lesser good than about a greater one.

- The greedy care more about wealth than about the kingdom of heaven.  
- Many care more to stay in sin than to gain virtue:

  - the sexually immoral,  
  - drunkards,  
  - gluttons,  
  - gamblers,  
  - the proud,  
  - liars, and the like.

It’s *this* evil kind of care that the Savior forbids.

But he does *not* forbid good care — in fact, he commands it.

Through Jeremiah God says:

> “Be careful to keep all the commandments that are written in the book of the law of Moses.”

And Paul says (Ephesians 4:3):

> “Be eager to guard the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace” — that is, in love.

So when the Savior says:

> “Don’t be anxious,”

he forbids evil anxiety, but not good diligence — nor honest work.

He doesn’t say:

> “Don’t work,”

but:

> “Don’t be anxious about your life” — that is, your earthly life —  
> “what you’ll eat, or about your body, what you’ll wear.  
> Is not your life worth more than food, and your body more than clothes?”


## Soul, Body, and Possessions — In the Right Order

Notice that Christ sets out three things the heavenly Father has given to a person:

1. the soul,  
2. the body,  
3. and what both need.

The soul is to be subject to God alone.  
The body is to be subject to the soul.  
And possessions are to be tools for both — as right reason demands.

Greedy people overturn this order:

- They sell both soul and body for possessions — like Judas.  

Others overturn the order in a different way:

- Their bodies rule over their souls — like gluttons, the sexually immoral, and others who bend their bodies toward mortal sin.

The Savior rejects two particular kinds of care:

1. **Care of “life”** — that is, anxiety about food.  
2. **Care of “the body”** — anxiety about clothing.

He puts aside these two like this:

The life of a person is more precious, more valuable, better than food.  
The body is better than clothes.  
Food and clothing exist *for* the person, not the other way around.

Since God gave you both your soul and your body,  
and he never abandons the order he himself made,  
he will also give food for your life and clothes for your body.

So there should not be a disordered, anxious care about food and clothing.

All our deepest effort should be turned toward God  
and toward virtue and virtuous deeds,  
so that we may be pleasing to him.  

There is where our care should rest.  
Otherwise, it’s disordered.

Any care that does not ultimately aim at one goal — eternal joy —  
is unworthy care.

Care about life and body must be measured this way:  
a person should care about food and clothing only as is fitting for his salvation.

So those who care mainly:

- to be rich,  
- to be admired by the world,  
- to dance,  
- to entertain themselves,  
- to play games that do nothing for salvation —

all such people, against this very teaching of Christ, are anxious in a disordered way.

Christ goes on:

> “Look at the birds of the air.”

Luke adds (Luke 12:24):

> “Notice the ravens, that they neither sow nor reap,  
> nor store up in barns;  
> yet your Father feeds them.”

Your Father — the one who created you — feeds you.  
And if you obey him, he will give you an inheritance: the kingdom of heaven.

> “Aren’t you worth far more than they are?”  

That is: How much more weight and value do you have than the birds!

You are rational, created for eternal joy.  
They are irrational, created for your sake, and will perish.

“And which of you, by thinking and worrying,  
can add a single arm’s length to his height?”  
In other words:  
No one. That’s not under your control.

Augustine explains:

It wasn’t by your power or authority that your body grew to its present height.  
If it wasn’t your power that made you grow,  
then it’s not your power that clothes you either.

Your body reached its height by God’s care, not by your anxiety.  
And even if you tried by constant thought to add one more length, you couldn’t.

So hand over your concern about clothing to the one whose care already made your body grow.

“And why are you anxious about clothes?  
Look at the lilies of the field, how they grow.  
They don’t work; they don’t spin.”

Here Jesus forbids disordered male care when he says “they don’t work,”  
and disordered female care when he says “they don’t spin.”

“For I tell you, not even Solomon, in all his glory” —  
though he was wise, rich, and powerful —  
“was clothed like one of these,”  
so beautifully white.


## The Lilies and God’s Care

In Latin the text says *Considerate lilia* — “Consider the lilies.”  
In Czech we don’t have a natural word for *lilium*; it’s a very white flower,  
and even Solomon couldn’t match its whiteness in his clothes.

It seems to me that by “lilies” Christ means many kinds of flowers.  
That’s why he says *lilia* in the plural — many blossoms:  
the lily, the rose, the violet, and other beautiful flowers.

Augustine says something like this:

> What silk, what royal purple, what painted weaving of the best workers  
> can compare with the flowers of the field?  
> What is as bright red as the rose?  
> What is as pure white as the lily?  
> What violet hue does purple surpass?

That’s Augustine.

“So if God clothes the grass of the field” —  
hay that’s alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven —  
“so beautifully, how much more will he clothe you,  
you of little faith.”

Augustine comments:

You who were created in the likeness of God,  
who belong to an eternal inheritance in heaven —  
your Creator will surely provide what you need  
and will not let you die of nakedness.

Christ continues:

> “So then, since this is true, don’t be anxious, saying,  
> ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’  
> For the pagans run after all these things.”

Pagans — people without true faith — think they live only for this present life.

Augustine says:

They chase these things because they don’t care about future things.  
They’re only interested in what’s earthly and present —  
like dumb animals rooting around for things of the earth.

As the prophet David says (Psalm 49:13, 21):

> “They became like senseless animals and grew to be like them.”

That’s Augustine.


## Seek First the Kingdom

“Your Father knows very well that you need all these things.”

Your Father — who cannot fail in power, in knowledge, or in generosity —  
knows exactly:

- when,  
- in what amount,  
- and in what way for your blessedness

you need these things.

So, believing this and trusting him not to abandon you,  

> “Seek first the kingdom of God” —  
> that is, desire most and be most eager for the joy of heaven —  
> “and his righteousness” — every virtue that leads to the kingdom of heaven —  
> “and all these things” — what you need for life and body —  
> “will be added to you” — in proper measure, in the way that serves your journey to that kingdom.

The Savior lays things out in order:

1. **First**: the kingdom — this we must seek *first*.  
2. **Second**: righteousness — the path that leads to that kingdom.  
3. **Last**: bodily necessities — food and clothing.

By this order he shows:

- the kingdom of heaven is the greatest good and should be the first object of our desire;  
- righteousness, by which we gain the kingdom, should be second in our desire;  
- food and clothing, the least, should be last.

May the dear Savior grant that we desire the joy of the eternal kingdom above all  
and that, by seeking it as Christ commands, we may finally reach it.

Amen.
