# Tenth Sunday After Holy Trinity

From the Gospel according to Luke, chapter 19, verses 41–47.

At that time, on what we now call Palm Sunday, when Jesus was coming near Jerusalem, Luke says: “As he came near and saw the city, he wept over it and said: ‘If only you had known, yes, you also—if only you had recognized on this day of yours the things that lead to peace. But now they are hidden from your eyes. For days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you, surround you, and hem you in on every side. They will throw you to the ground, you and your children within you, and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not recognize the time when you were visited.’”

And when he had entered the temple—our dear King, who began with the priests, taking vengeance for the wrongs done to God and giving an example to kings, princes, and lords—he began to drive out those who were selling and buying there, saying to them: “It is written (as Isaiah writes in chapter 56, verse 7): ‘My house is a house of prayer’—that is, a house set apart for prayer, not for greed—‘but you have made it a den of robbers,’ for you plunder people there like bandits.” And he was teaching in the temple every day.

In this reading our gracious Savior shows three things about himself: mercy, truth, and justice.

He shows mercy because, when he saw the future troubles of Jerusalem, he wept over it.  
He shows truth because everything he prophesied came to pass.  
He shows justice because he drove the traders out of the temple.

Let us go through each in order, and then apply it to ourselves.

**1. Christ’s mercy: he weeps over Jerusalem**

Luke says: “As Jesus drew near to Jerusalem,” riding on a young donkey on Palm Sunday, “he saw the city and wept over it.” He was weeping over it because he knew that after forty-two years Titus and Vespasian, Roman commanders, would destroy it—its people and its buildings. But the people of Jerusalem did not know this.

That is why he said, “If only you had known—even you.”  
In other words: *If you, people of Jerusalem, knew your coming ruin as I know it, you too would be weeping.*

Notice the mercy of our Savior in his tears. He wept so deeply that he sobbed, and in the middle of his sobbing he said, “If only you had known—even you…” and he could not at once finish the word “you would have wept” because of his choking tears.

He continues: “on this day of yours”—that is, in the short time that is now yours, when your will is still free and you still rejoice. “On this day of yours” means: *today is the day given to you, when your King—your true God and true Man—comes to you riding on a donkey, desiring peace for you; and you, Jerusalem, rejoice, having the things that could bring you peace.*

“But now,” he says, “they are hidden from your eyes”—that is, your coming heavy troubles are hidden from your outward and inward eyes.

“For days will come upon you,” that is, after forty-two years, “when vengeance will be carried out against you. Your enemies”—Titus and Vespasian—“will surround you with an embankment,” meaning they will fence you in with a rampart of earth, “and they will encircle you”—with ditches, watchtowers, and garrisons.

And this is exactly what happened. Titus and Vespasian dug a trench and built up a rampart all around the whole city, and they set up strongholds all around so that no one could escape. They besieged the city so tightly that it happened at the greatest of the Jewish feasts, Passover, when countless people had gathered.

The Jews of Jerusalem did not believe this prophecy of Christ. Jeremiah had already lamented this blindness in his *Lamentations* (Tren. 4:12): “The kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the world did not believe that an enemy could ever enter the gates of Jerusalem.”

And the prophet Isaiah had already spoken for God (Isaiah 29:3): “I will encamp against you all around and will lay siege to you with a rampart and raise siegeworks against you.” And so it happened.

**2. The fulfilled judgment: the horror that actually came**

Christ goes on: “They will hem you in on every side, and they will crush you everywhere.” That means: you will not be able to escape, and you will not even have food to eat.

History confirms it. Josephus writes that in that siege one noblewoman, named Mary, ate her own son. When the city watchmen discovered it, they told everyone in the city. Then all the people wept, and with loud crying and wailing they opened the city gates. So the heathen entered and began to kill and burn everything without mercy.

In this way the lament of Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled (Lamentations 4:13): it happened “because of the sins of her prophets and the guilt of her priests, who shed in her midst the blood of the righteous.” They had shed the innocent blood of Christ, of Stephen, of James, and of other righteous people.

About the eating of their children, God had already said in Deuteronomy 28:53: “If you will not keep my commandments, you will eat the fruit of your own body—the flesh of your sons and daughters that the Lord your God gave you—in distress and in destruction,” *in vastitate*.

Josephus also says that each day the Romans crucified about five hundred people whom they captured by day and by night.

And, as Saint Augustine says, the Romans had that victory from God, although they believed that their false gods had given it to them. Augustine says that in God’s hand the Romans were like the switch in the hand of an angry, unyielding king, and like the axe of God with which the Jews, for their deserts, were punished. In that time the Romans utterly overthrew the Jewish city and nation.

So the very thing they tried to avoid by killing Christ came upon them because of his death. For Caiaphas had said, together with the chief priests and scribes, when they met in council (John 11:47–48): “What are we doing? This man is doing many signs. If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away our city and our nation.”

Fearing *that*, they killed innocent Jesus, and *fell into the very thing they feared*.

And it may also be that something similar will happen to today’s priests, who, being afraid that their wealth might decrease, do not allow the word of God to be preached. Even if other people do not lose their property before death, those priests will lose everything at death, for they will not take any of it with them.

The prophet David says (Psalm 76:6): “Rich men have fallen asleep in their sleep”—that is, they have died—“and they have found nothing in their hands.” Many, being afraid of losing their goods, have forbidden faithful service and refused to serve. And therefore, by God’s judgment, they have in fact lost some of their goods.

Christ also said: “They will throw you to the ground,” that is, they will cast you down, “and your children within you”—meaning, they will throw to the ground and slaughter your people. “They will not leave in you one stone upon another.”

This also came true. Jerusalem now stands in another place; the tomb of Christ is now outside the present city, and so is the place where he was crucified, which was once outside the old city walls. The one who finally fulfilled Christ’s words was the Roman emperor Hadrian (whom Hus calls Elias Adrian). Sent again by the Romans, he leveled the whole city.

So the prophecy of Micah 3:12 was fulfilled: “Zion”—that is, the hill of Jerusalem—“will be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem will become a heap of stones.”

Why did this have to happen to that city? Our Savior gives the reason: “Because you did not recognize the time when you were visited”—meaning the time when your Creator visited you by becoming man, preaching among you, raising your dead, healing your sick, and coming to you as a poor, gentle, humble King, riding on a donkey, just as the prophet Zechariah had spoken (Zechariah 9:9): “Look, your King comes to you—righteous and bringing salvation. He is poor, and riding on a donkey, on a young donkey.”

Because the people of Jerusalem did not recognize this visitation—because they refused to know their King—this destruction came upon the people and the city.

And the priests were the first in this sin of not recognizing the visitation of their Savior. When he was riding on the donkey, they were there, and they tried to stop people praising him when the crowd was praising him.

Just before today’s reading, Luke tells us (Luke 19:37–40) that when Jesus came near the descent of the Mount of Olives, “the whole multitude of disciples began to rejoice and to praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen, saying: ‘Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!’”

But some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!”

He answered, “I tell you, if these were silent, the stones would cry out!”

And right after that Luke says: “As he came near and saw the city, he wept over it.”

So you see clearly: the people rejoiced and confessed the visitation of their King and Savior. But afterward they were led astray by the priests, who in this very place had tried to stop them from confessing his visitation, and later delivered him up to death.

**3. The root of judgment: sins in the house of God**

To make it clear where the punishment was going to spring from, as from its root, Jesus “entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and bought there, saying: ‘It is written: My house will be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers!’”

Here Saint Gregory says: as soon as Christ had foretold the coming evil—the punishment—he immediately went into the temple to drive out the sellers and buyers.

By this he plainly showed that the downfall of the people came mainly from the sin of the priests. Having prophesied the ruin of the city, he struck the sellers and buyers in the temple. By that act he showed where the root of destruction had begun.

From another evangelist (Matthew 21:12) we learn that in the temple they were selling doves. What do these doves symbolize? The gift of the Holy Spirit.

Christ drives the sellers and buyers out of the temple because he condemns both those who accept money for laying on hands and those who think they can buy the gift of the Holy Spirit.

About this same temple he immediately says: “My house is a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers.”

Gregory’s meaning is this: the priests were the root cause of Jerusalem’s ruin because they turned God’s house into a den of thieves, robbing people there by their greed.

Gregory continues: The house of prayer has been made a den of robbers. For they stood in the temple in order to resist, with physical force, those who would not give them gifts, and to murder, spiritually, those who did give.

Even though the priests opposed Christ, because he rebuked their sins and drove them out of the temple like thieves, our merciful Savior did not give up preaching. The reading ends: “He was teaching in the temple every day”—from that day until Thursday he was teaching his disciples, the people, and even the priests, in the temple.

So much for how it was fulfilled historically in Jerusalem according to our Savior’s prophecy.

**4. Applying this to ourselves: learning from Christ’s tears**

It would profit us little to know these things if we did not apply them usefully to ourselves. Therefore, seeing Christ’s mercy in his compassionate tears, his truth in his fulfilled prophecy, and his justice in his judgment on the priests and the destruction of Jerusalem, let us now recognize that our merciful Savior did not weep only over that city, but also over our sins and for our sins.

In this he gave an example to every believer. We should not only weep over our own sins, but also over the sins of others.

He, who had no sin at all, wept not just once but three times, as Scripture clearly shows: once over Lazarus when he was about to raise him from the dead (John 11:35); a second time, as this Gospel says, over Jerusalem; and a third time on the cross, as Saint Paul writes to the Hebrews (Hebrews 5:7), that Christ “offered up prayers to the Father, who was able to save him from death, with loud cries and tears, and he was heard because of his reverence.”

If the Master wept so often and so deeply, how can his servant—who is stained with many sins—not weep for his own sins and the sins of others?

Every sin, especially mortal sin, is an insult to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and is a wound to the whole communion of saints on earth. That servant is unfaithful who does not grieve over the dishonor and shame done to his Lord God, the merciful Father, and over the harm done to his mother, the holy Church.

Again, whoever could correct something and does not care to, shares in the sin. Every person in this world who has sound reason, if he does not grieve over his own sins and the sins of others, though he could help to make things better and does not, shares in those sins.

And especially guilty is the one who rejoices in his sin and in the sins of others. Such a person ignores the tears of his Savior and does not care about the words of Christ, who says (Matthew 5:4): “Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted,” and again (Luke 6:21): “Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.”

Our merciful Savior, “when he drew near and saw the city, wept over it and said: ‘If only you had known—even you…’”—you would have wept as I, your Creator, am visiting you in tears.

If only a sinner could see what evil sin is doing to him; if only he could see what will meet him at death and after death if he does not repent with sorrow, he would surely weep now, even if he is rejoicing today.

Solomon says about sinners (Proverbs 2:14): “They rejoice when they do evil and they delight in the worst of things.”

**5. “This day of yours” – the short joy of sinners**

How long will this last? Not long. Christ says: “On this day of yours, which is for your peace”—that is, the day in which you are rejoicing now. By “this day” the Savior means the short time in which sinners delight themselves. Their joy quickly passes.

Job says (Job 20:5): “The joy of the hypocrite is like the blink of an eye.”  
And again (Job 21:12–13): “They take up the timbrel and harp and rejoice to the sound of music. They spend their days in pleasure and in a moment go down to hell.”

Therefore Christ says, “this day of yours.”

Saint Gregory comments: The wicked soul has its own day here, when it rejoices in passing time and enjoys those things that it thinks are for its peace. When it delights in possessions, when it is lifted up by honors, when it lets itself go in bodily pleasure, when it does not fear any coming torment, it has peace in *its* day.

But that soul will suffer a great stumbling of its own damnation in the *other* day. Then it will be tormented when the righteous rejoice, and all the things that now seem to give it peace will then be turned into the bitterness of strife. It will begin to quarrel with itself, asking why it did not fear the punishment it now endures, and why it closed its eyes to the things it should have been looking at.

So it is said to that soul: “But now these things are hidden from your eyes.”  
For the perverted soul, satisfied and inclined toward present pleasures, loosened in earthly delights, hides future evils from itself. It does not want to consider what is coming, lest such thoughts disturb its false peace. And so, while it abandons itself to a life of pleasure, what else is it doing but closing its eyes and walking into the fire?

All this is from Saint Gregory.

Christ continues: “Days will come upon you when your enemies will surround you with an embankment.” First he had said, “this day of yours,” but now he says, “days will come upon you.” For in this world consolation is short, but for some, torment in purgatory is long, and for others the torment of hell is eternal.

The worst enemies of the soul, as Gregory says, are the evil spirits. They surround the soul when it leaves the body. They have fed it during its bodily life with many false delights. Then, in that hour, they close it in like a rampart by bringing before the eyes of its mind all the evils it has done, and they drag it into the fellowship of their own damnation.

They press the soul so that, as it is seized at the end of life, it sees by which enemies it is surrounded and finds no way to escape; for then it can no longer do good, or it has been ashamed to do the good that it ought to have done.

Thus we can understand what the Savior says: “Your enemies will surround you with an embankment, and they will encircle you and hem you in on every side and throw you down to the ground, you and your children within you.”

Evil spirits torment the soul from every side when they recall not only its evil deeds, but also its evil words and evil thoughts, so that the soul, which had once spread itself wide in sin, may at last be tightly pressed in punishment.

“And they will throw you to the ground, you and your children within you.” The soul is thrown to the ground when its body—whose lusts it had followed—is driven back to dust. And its “children” die when the evil thoughts that were born from it are scattered as punishment at the end of life.

For it is written (Psalm 146:4): “On that day”—that last day—“their thoughts will perish.” And because those thoughts are hard, they can be symbolized by stones. Therefore Christ adds: “They will not leave in you one stone upon another.”

A perverted mind, when it thinks evil and adds one evil thought to another, is doing nothing else but piling stone upon stone. But in a city that is destroyed, no stone is left upon another. When the soul is brought to judgment, all that structure of its evil thinking is scattered.

Why must the soul endure this? Christ immediately shows the reason: “Because you did not recognize the time when you were visited.”

The Almighty Lord often visits a wicked soul in many ways. He visits it always by his commandments. Sometimes he visits it with stripes, sometimes with wonders, so that it may hear the truth it has not known. If it remains proud and hard, perhaps at least pain may turn it back, or, overcome by kindness, it may be ashamed of the evil it has done.

But if in the end it does none of this, it will be handed over to its enemies, and by God’s judgment will be bound with them in the fellowship of eternal damnation.

**6. Christ still cleanses his temple today**

The reading then says: “He entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought.”

Saint Gregory writes: Just as there is a temple of God in the city, so in the believing people the life of the clergy is like a temple. Many take on the clerical robe, and when they receive ordination, instead of using the holy office as they ought, they drag it into the profit of worldly business.

The sellers in the temple are those who, for money, give to others what by right belongs to them. To sell justice is to give it only for gifts received.

The buyers in the temple are those who do not want to give their neighbor what is rightfully due, and instead of doing what is just, they give money to patrons—judges, lords, or prelates—to buy themselves out of guilt. Such people are buying sin.

To such people these words rightly apply: “My house is a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers.” For often, when corrupt people hold spiritual offices, they slay others with the sword of their wickedness in the very place where they should have nourished them by prayer.

All this is from Gregory.

If only priests, prelates, and monks who drag their office into money-making would weigh these holy words! They turn baptism, the mass, prayers, the consecration of churches and altars, ordinations to priesthood and bishopric, absolutions and blessings, anointings and funerals, and other spiritual things into opportunities for bodily gain.

I have written more fully about this in my Czech books *On Simony*.

Those words of Gregory also apply to all who, though they owe something to their neighbor, do not make proper restitution, but give money to a judge, a lord, or a prelate and want to be excused in that way. They are the buyers, and the rulers are the sellers. They are driven out of the company of the saints, and if they do not repent, on the Day of Judgment they will be cast out from the temple of the kingdom of heaven.

All should also take this to heart who, having the duty to feed their neighbors with God’s word, with good example, and with prayer, stand back in their holy office and instead drown others by their bad example or their negligence. Such people turn the house of their own conscience into a den of robbers, though it should be a temple—a house of devout prayer.

Saint Gregory says: The mind of wicked people is no longer a house of prayer but a den of robbers when the soul has abandoned innocence and the straightness of holiness and only plans how it might harm its neighbor.

And because our Redeemer continually teaches us by his words against all these evils, this is also what is meant when the Gospel testifies that “he was teaching in the temple every day.” For whenever he firmly instructs the minds of believers to keep away from evil, *Truth himself*—Christ—teaches daily in his temple.

---

**7. An example for preachers and believers**

So we have seen that our merciful Savior wept over sins, scourged sinners, drove them out of the temple, scattered their money, rebuked their words—and then every day preached in the temple.

In this he gave an example to faithful preachers of his word: that they should grieve over human sins, and, grieving, should preach against them out of Scripture—especially against simony—and that they should stand firm in this until death, as Christ did, not running away from the truth out of fear with which the dealers in holy things try to frighten anyone who touches their sin, so that he would turn away from God’s word.

For the Savior says (Matthew 10:22): “You will be hated by all”—that is, by all wicked people—“for my name’s sake. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.”

May you, dear Savior, who wept over our sins, help us to that endurance and to that blessed end.
