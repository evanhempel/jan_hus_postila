### READING FOR THE FOURTH SUNDY IN ADVENT.
St. John writes in the 1st chapter, verses 19-26.
At that time the Jews from Jerusalem sent priests and deacons to John, to ask him (saying: Who are you? And he confessed [that he is not the Christ] and did not deny [what he was]; and he confessed, that I am not the Christ. And they asked him: What [are you] then? Art thou Elijah? And he answered: I am not [that Elijah in person, as you ask]! Art thou the Prophet? And he answered: Nothing [i.e. I am not that prophet, as you mean]! Then they said to him: Who are you? Let us give an answer to those who sent us; what sayest thou of thyself? He says: I am the voice of one crying [Christ] in the wilderness [of this world]: make straight [by good deeds] the path of the Lord [God], as Isaiah the prophet says [in ch. 40 v. 3]. And those who were sent were of the lawyers [who opposed the truth the most]; and they asked him and said to him: Why then do you baptize, since you are not Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet? John answered them, saying: I baptize in water [that is, I wash with water], but among you there has stood [he acts both according to divinity and according to humanity], whom you do not know [that he is God and Christ]; he it is, who will come after me [to baptize with the Holy Spirit], the one who was made before me [worthier in dignity in his humanity], the strap of whose shoe I am not worthy to untie (if he had shoes). These things happened in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

This holy reading shows the goodness of St. John and the malice of the priests, and thus teaches faithful Christians to follow St. John in goodness, and not to fall into priestly malice. John's goodness shows itself in the confession of truth and in humility: he confessed the truth, saying what he was not, and not denying what he was; he showed humility, saying: I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness! The malice of the priests, who sent and who were sent, shows itself in this: that the life of St. John was hateful to them, as the reading testifies; for they say: "Why then do you baptize?" And our Savior says in St. Matt. ch. 11 v. 18: John came neither eating, i.e. meat, nor drinking, namely wine, and they say: He has a Devil! that is, within him.

Secondly, their malice shows itself in that they do not want to be satisfied with a good answer, but press on, saying: "Why then do you baptize, since you are not Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?" Oh, what malice the current priests have, who call others, who live well, devilish ones! for when they call them heretics and errant, then in that they hold them as devilish. And this the Savior prophesied to his faithful in St. Matt. ch. 10 v. 25 saying: If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his household? And just as they forbade John to baptize, saying: Why then do you baptize? so the current ones forbid both preaching and baptizing and serving mass to those who lead God's truth. They themselves do not preach the truth strictly, so that people might leave off sins, and they forbid others; just as those priests did not preach God's law, and forbade Christ, stopping his mouth, as St. Luke testifies 11, 53, and cursing those who believed in him, as St. John testifies 9, 28. The current ones do the same, sending their messengers from Rome and from Prague, and obtaining bulls to stop preaching in chapels and to burn books; as happened under Archbishop Zbyněk, and now happens in the confusions of the Prague Archbishopric. Alas! They do not listen that God says in this reading: Make straight the way of God! John made it straight, he himself lived well, he showed the way to salvation to others, he rebuked for sins, and how they should live, he showed by his preaching; therefore he also said: "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, make straight the way of God!"

Here we should mark that St. John humbly confessed his frailty, saying: "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness," that is: I am the calling from him who calls in the wilderness. And understand thus, that St. John is God's crier, he preaches in the wilderness and calls people to repentance, saying Lucae in ch. 3 v. 8: Do worthy fruits of repentance, for the kingdom of heaven draws near. And this calling God does, who calls to repentance; God calls man through every creature, as St. Augustine says Lib. 11. Conf.: Heaven and earth and all things that are in heaven and on earth, behold they tell me everywhere that I should love you, nor do they cease to tell all men, so that they can have no excuse that they did not love God. Secondly, God calls in the wilderness of this world, because every man is very fragile; therefore he said to Isaiah in ch. 40 v. 6: Cry! And Isaiah: What shall I cry? And God to him: All flesh is grass, and all the glory thereof as the flower of the field! Signifying this, Solomon, being deceived by the vanity of the world, says Eccl. ult., 12, 8: Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity! that is: a man who gives himself to any things whatsoever, having abandoned God, finds for himself nothing but vanity; for the comfort of all things shall perish from him. Therefore it is necessary for man to serve God diligently, and to use the things which the Lord God gave him for nothing further than for His praise and for his own salvation; and thus that he should first know himself: who is he? what kind is he? where is he? and where will he be? Who? That he is a human created by God and redeemed by His blood; and what kind is he? that because of sins he is miserable and in deeds unstable; and where is he? that he is in a miserable world, which is a true wilderness, full of poisonous snakes, i.e. priests and other evil detractors, to whom St. John and Christ said that they are a generation of vipers. And where will he be? Woe if he falls into eternal fire!

And surely, if man looked often into himself and knew himself, then he could know God, and many other things for his own benefit. Therefore the wise men had written above the door of their school this motto: "Know thyself!" so that whoever wants to know wisdom, should begin first from himself; for he who does not truly know himself, how can he know other things? St. John, knowing himself, what he is, confessed humbly that he is the voice of one crying in the wilderness; and he knew and announced the dignity of the Savior, saying: "I baptize in water," showing that He will baptize after me; but among you, strictly as God, and also strictly as He is man, stands He whom you, for your sin and for ignorance of prophecy, do not know. He it is, who will baptize, preach and teach after me, just as after me He began in life according to humanity, and was born after me; he, who was made before me: not made according to divinity, nor created before according to humanity, but he who before me and before every man is first in dignity.

Here remember, that Christ is not made in divinity, and that strictly as a man he is made after St. John, and yet in dignity he is made the most first: And this dignity John confesses, saying: "Whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose." As if he said: And what wonder is it, that he is more worthy than I, whom I know, that he was born after me, but the mystery of his birth I do not fully know? Thus says St. Gregory In Om. And thus by the strap, with which the shoe is tied to the foot, is understood the union of Christ's humanity with the divinity; for the Son of God took humanity upon himself by that likeness, that as first is the foot, and the foot remains and takes upon itself a shoe and is hidden under the shoe: so the divinity in the person of the Son of God took upon itself humanity and remained divinity, hidden to bodily eyes under humanity. And of this union of divinity with humanity John is not worthy to unloose, as he says, confessing humbly his lack of skill in this: I am not worthy to unloose the latchet of his shoe.

From this speech the black monk brothers argue against the barefoot ones, that Christ walked in shoes like them, saying that John would not have spoken of his shoes thus, if He did not have them; and the barefoot ones in return say against them, that Christ walked barefoot like them, for otherwise Mary Magdalene could not have washed his feet with tears at the feast. But in this quarrel neither the former nor the latter have good proof, but sin remains with them both, that they do not want to follow the poor Christ without the desire for property, and thus having excessive desire for property, both have not shod their feet; but Christ, who underwent poverty for us, was in his mind shod against the desire of temporal property, and if He pleased, then sometimes He walked in shoes and sometimes barefoot. And this I dare not untie, whether He ever walked in shoes, or never walked so; but I am satisfied with this, that for me, a sinner, He walked upon the earth, however He pleased.
