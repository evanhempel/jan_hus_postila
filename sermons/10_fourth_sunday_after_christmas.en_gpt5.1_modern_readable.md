# Fourth Sunday After Christmas

From Matthew, chapter 8, verses 1–13.

At that time, in the first year of his preaching, when Jesus came down from the mountain (St Jerome says: Tabor), great crowds followed him. And look—there came a man with leprosy. He bowed before him and pleaded, saying: “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.” Jesus stretched out his hand, touched him, and said: “I am willing. Be clean.” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. Then Jesus said to him: “Tell no one (so he would not become proud because he had been healed), but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded (for those cleansed from leprosy), as a testimony to them (so that the priests would testify about him that he was no longer a leper). And when Jesus entered Capernaum (that town), a centurion (a captain over soldiers) came to him, pleading with him and saying: “Lord, my servant lies at home paralyzed and suffering terribly.” Jesus said to him: “I will come and heal him.” But the centurion answered: “Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” When Jesus heard this, he was amazed, and said to those who were following him: “Truly, I tell you, I have not found such great faith in Israel (in the Jewish people). And I tell you this: many will come from the east and the west and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” Then Jesus said to the centurion: “Go. Let it be done for you as you have believed.” And his servant was healed at that very hour.

**A.** This holy reading, for the strengthening and teaching of believers, lays before us two miracles that our Savior did out of his great power and mercy: first, that he healed a leper, and second, that he healed one paralyzed and broken in his limbs. By these he proved his divine power and mercy, so that we would believe that he is the mighty God and trust that he is gracious.

“Great crowds followed him” for many different reasons: some because of his famous way of life, some out of true devotion, some just as spectators who wanted to hear something strange or see miracles, the sick so they might be healed, some hungry so they might be fed; and the priests and scribes followed so that, catching him in some deed or word, they could criticize and insult him. All these kinds of people can be found in the Gospel readings.

“And look, a leper came and bowed before him.” Saint Mark says (1:40) that the leper knelt down on his knees and confessed the immeasurable power of Christ: leaving other physicians, he came to Jesus, knelt, and pleaded, saying: “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”

Here every sinner has a lesson: once you know that there is no one who can cleanse a person from spiritual leprosy except the Lord God alone, you must run to him, humble yourself before him, and pray that he would be pleased to cleanse your soul from the leprosy of sin.

**B.** Know this: in Scripture, leprosy means mortal sin. First, because in the Old Testament—as even now—lepers were put outside the community so that they did not live, eat, drink, or have fellowship with the people; in the same way, mortal sin spiritually drives a person out of the fellowship of the holy Church, so that he does not eat the body of Christ with her, does not drink his blood, and does not partake of anything for spiritual salvation as long as that sin remains in him.

In Czech it is rightly called *malomocenství*—“little-power-ness,” and the person is *malomocný*—“one of little power”; for a person in mortal sin can do very little: he cannot worthily pray, eat, or drink, and he is cut off from all sharing in holy things. So in German he is well called *aussätzich*, that is, “set outside,” put out from the holy fellowship.

If a person really understood and weighed this, he would choose a thousand times rather to become leprous in his body than to fall into mortal sin. For if he had leprosy in the body, and bore it patiently and avoided sin, he would be a great saint. But what good is it to a person if he is very beautiful and healthy in body, yet leprous in soul through sin, and therefore extremely repulsive to God? And if he dies like that, he will be condemned forever with the devils—unless he comes in great humility and prays to the Savior, saying: “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”

Notice how wisely the leper asks. When he says, “Lord,” he confesses Christ’s majesty, that he is Lord of the whole world. When he says, “if you are willing,” he confesses Christ’s will is free and sovereign. When he says, “you can,” he confesses his great power. So he lays his hope and his healing in Christ’s will and power, for whatever Christ is pleased to will, he is able to do.

And he wisely puts his healing into Christ’s will, as if he said: “I do not know whether it is your will that I be healed, nor do I know whether bodily health would actually be good for me.” By this he teaches us that we should not ask for bodily health unless it is God’s will and for our spiritual benefit.

“Jesus stretched out his hand, touched him, and said: ‘I am willing. Be clean.’” Here the Savior shows his humility: with his holy hand he is willing to touch a leper. Second, he shows his readiness to hear, when a person asks rightly—“I am willing.” Third, he shows his divine power when he says: “Be clean!” In Latin it says: *mundare*. Some unlearned people think that word *mundare* here simply means “to wash clean,” but it should not be understood so shallowly.

**C.** Understand that our merciful Savior did not stretch out his hand and touch the leper for nothing. His hand touching the man signifies that his body, his humanity, was like an instrument or member of the Godhead for doing miracles; yet it was the divine nature, acting through his humanity, that did the miracles.

Second, Christ’s touch shows this: in the old law, even though touching a leper was forbidden, it was not forbidden to someone who would not be defiled by touching, but rather, by touching, would give health to the one he touched. So Elijah touched the dead boy whom he raised (3 Kings 17:21), and Elisha also touched a dead man and raised him by God’s power (4 Kings 4:34). By this same power Christ healed this leper, about whom the reading says: “And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.”

Then Christ commands the leper, saying: “Tell no one.” This can be understood in different ways.

First, in this Christ gives an example to priests, prelates, and others: when they do something good, they should not boast, nor desire that the one they have helped would praise them for it. Many priests sin greatly against this. They boast that they have power to heal the leprous soul, to absolve, to send people to heaven or to hell as they please. And then lay people, if they give something to someone, want heralds to proclaim it. If they do anything “for God,” they immediately want a name for it, want their shields or inscriptions put up as a sign.

To such people Christ says under oath in Matthew 5: “They do all their works to be seen by people; truly, I tell you, they have already received their reward.” Under that same oath are also priests and clerics who celebrate mass and say the hours and do other works just so that people will see them.

Second, “Tell no one” may mean: do not go around bragging over others that you have been healed, in a way that offends or discourages them.

Third, as Saint Jerome says, there was no need for speech when the deed itself was obvious.

Fourth, that he should tell no one before he first told the priests, so that they, as the first confessors of God’s truth, might proclaim Christ’s work to the people. That is why Christ immediately adds: “But go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded” in the fourteenth chapter of Leviticus.

**D.** Here priests claim that people are commanded by God to bring them offerings: some say they must be given seven times a year, others say three times a year every person must “offer” to them, and that from confession people must give them money, saying: “See, Christ says to the healed man, ‘Go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded.’”

If only priests understood that Christ sent those healed from leprosy to the priests so that the priests would believe that Christ is the true God, because he heals in this way—and second, so that the priests would tell the people that he, Christ, not they, cleanses from leprosy! This they do not proclaim; instead they proclaim that people must confess to them, that they have the power to cleanse, to forgive sins, and that they may take money for it.

But Christ did not send the healed to the priests for that. As Saint Jerome says, he sent them so that the priests would believe in the Savior; as Saint John Chrysostom says, so they would not accuse him of despising the law of Moses; and as Origen says, so it would be clear that the man was not healed by the rituals of the law, but by the grace of Christ. And also so the priests could declare publicly that this man was now allowed to live in the community as a healthy person.

**E.** The saints also understand this spiritually: often, before a person goes to confession, God has already forgiven his sin. Still, out of humility, the sinner should go to a wise priest, confess his sins to him, ask for good instruction, and receive from him a fitting penance by which he will be restrained and not fall back into sin. In this way the sinner “shows himself to the priest.”

But if he had to offer exactly what was commanded for a cleansed leper in the Old Testament as a figure—where would he get it? He would have to offer two sparrows, a loaf, six measures of oil, cedar wood, hyssop, and many other things. But, as Saint Remigius explains: the two sparrows represent soul and body; the loaf represents love; the six measures of oil represent six kinds of mercy; and the hyssop represents humility. Whoever offers these things truly fulfills Christ’s command about the offering. But a greedy priest does not gladly receive such an offering. He would rather take a single coin than see all those virtues living in a person!

Then the reading continues: “When he entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, begging him.”

After Christ had healed a Jew, he came into Capernaum, that town, to do good also to a Gentile. For this centurion was a pagan officer, appointed by the Romans to rule that town of Capernaum, which was the chief city of that region of Galilee.

That believing centurion, as Saint Luke witnesses (7:3,6), first sent Jewish elders of his district to Jesus. And when he heard back from the messengers that Jesus was coming to him, then—as others say, and it is likely—he himself went out on the road, out of humility and devotion, and respectfully tried to keep Jesus from coming into his house. He knew that, according to Jewish custom and the way they separated themselves, it was not considered proper for Jews to share a house, or to eat and drink, with a pagan.

This fits with the centurion’s words: “Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.” And Jesus, knowing the faith he had in Christ’s divinity, did not lament or complain about him, as he did about the nobleman in John 4:47, who begged Jesus to hurry and come before his son died. Instead, Jesus speaks willingly to the centurion, as to one who truly believes, saying that he will come and heal his paralyzed servant.

But the centurion, believing that Christ is God and knowing his own lowliness, admits that he is not worthy for Christ to enter under the roof of his house. He says it is enough for him if Christ, out of his immeasurable power and mercy, will only speak the word at a distance and his servant will at once be healed.

The centurion proves this by an argument: since he himself, set under authority by the emperor, can command his servants and they immediately do what he orders, then how much more can the Emperor of the whole world, present everywhere according to his divine nature, command any of his creatures and be immediately obeyed? For the power of God in Christ to command every creature is infinitely greater than the centurion’s power to command the emperor’s servants.

“When Jesus heard this”—this confession of such great faith from a Gentile soldier—“he was amazed, and said to those following him that he had not found such great faith in Israel,” that is, among the Jewish people.

**F.** Someone might object to this and say: “But amazement comes from something newly known; and since Jesus from eternity knows and sees all things, how then could he be amazed?” The answer is that Christ has a twofold knowledge: one divine, by which he knows all things from eternity; and another according to his human senses. Just as Scripture says he later saw with bodily eyes what he had not seen earlier, and later heard, tasted, or touched what he had not previously sensed, so here, as man, he now hears this particular confession of the centurion’s great faith which, as man, he had not previously heard, and according to that human knowing he is said to “be amazed.”

Yet another sharp critic might say that Christ does not tell the truth when he says, “I have not found such great faith in Israel,” for in his own mother, the Virgin Mary, he found the same, indeed a greater, faith—and also in his apostles.

The answer can be this: by “Israel” here he can mean the descendants of that one father Jacob, not every person dwelling in the land of Israel. And by “found” Christ speaks according to his human experience, while as God he eternally knew all things. So we should understand it this way: as man, in the descendants of Jacob Christ had not yet found such great faith. But in the Virgin Mary and in his apostles, whom he had earlier chosen and enlightened as God, he knew a greater faith—but he had not as man yet “found” it in this public way.

Saint Augustine and Saint Jerome think this: that Christ had not found such faith at that time among the Jews, except in the holy patriarchs, in whom the foundation of faith was laid, and in the prophets. But Saint John Chrysostom thinks this refers to how quickly the faith appeared: others believed only after they had seen signs and miracles, but this centurion, without seeing, only hearing about Christ, already had such great faith.

Which of these explanations is closest to the truth, may God grant us to embrace, always holding firmly to this: that Christ spoke truth when he said, “I have not found such great faith in Israel.”

With this word he rebuked the ungrateful, unbelieving Jews, and he exalted the grateful Gentiles. Therefore he goes on to say that from every side of the world chosen Gentiles will turn to the faith and will rest with the holy fathers in the kingdom of heaven.

**G.** “But the sons of the kingdom,” that is, the Jews—his own people by birth—“will be thrown out into the outer darkness,” that is, into the loss of heavenly light in hell.

These “outer” darknesses are called so, first, to distinguish them from the “inner” darkness, which is the absence of God’s grace in the soul: that is, sins, which are inner darkness. Second, because those in hell, cast into that outer darkness, are now without any hope of grace or deliverance. Their darkness is “outer,” that is, without end. But the darkness of sinners here, who repent, is not endless and therefore not “outer” in that sense.

Even if there were no other punishment than that darkness of hell, which will never end, a person should be more than afraid enough and guard himself very carefully against sin. The Savior does not speak of that darkness in the Gospel for nothing, naming it so often.

And because that darkness alone will not be all, the Savior adds that “there will be weeping and gnashing” or grinding “of teeth.” There will be endless pain—inner, in the soul, and outer, in the body. By “weeping” he means inner pain, not that physical tears will constantly flow from their eyes, as they do here. For there, the damned will not drink, and the terrible fire will be burning them; therefore they will not have tears as they do in this life.

Then “gnashing of teeth”—the clashing of those hard bones from pain—means the torment with which the body will be afflicted. It is enough, from all the torments named in Scripture about the damned, to set before yourself: the loss of eternal joy, eternal darkness, eternal fire, and from these things an immense sorrow in the soul, because there will never be an end to them, and so, without hope forever, pain and torture in soul and body.

Therefore Isaiah says (66:24): “Their worm will not die and their fire will not be quenched.” That worm is the gnawing torment in the soul; that fire is the eternal burning of the body. So Christ says on the day of judgment to the damned (Matthew 25:41): “Go away from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his servants.”

Also, by “weeping” we understand their sorrow, and by “gnashing of teeth” we understand the eternal sin of the damned, by which they will forever oppose themselves to the eternal goodness of the Lord God.

At the end, Jesus says to the centurion, that faithful soldier, that it will be done for him according to his faith and desire; and it happened wonderfully, for “the servant was healed at that very hour.” Scripture calls him “a boy” or “child,” but it means his servant, as it often does.

Here we learn that the measure of God’s grace given to a person follows the measure of that person’s faith; therefore the commentator says: to each, as he believes, so it is done for him.

In this good centurion we are given an example. First, we see great humility, when he says: “Lord, I am not worthy…” Saint John Chrysostom comments: the centurion made himself unworthy to receive Christ into his house, and thus he was made worthy of Christ’s kingdom.

Second, in him there is great faith, for Christ says: “I have not found such great faith in Israel.”

Third, in him there is wisdom, in how he reasons that Christ is almighty.

Fourth, in him there is goodness, in how earnestly he cares for the health of his servant.

So let us, taking example from this good Gentile, be humble before our dear Christ, confessing our unworthiness. Let us have great faith, believing that he is almighty and can do whatever he is pleased to do. Let us be wise, learning wisdom from Scripture so that we may truly know God. And finally, let us be good—loving God and our neighbor, and seeking the health and salvation of our own soul and of our neighbor’s soul. Amen.
