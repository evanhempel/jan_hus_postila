title: Thirteenth Sunday After Holy Trinity
---

This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon for the Thirteenth Sunday After Holy Trinity, based on Luke 10:23-37. The sermon explores themes of blessedness, love for God and neighbor, and the parable of the Good Samaritan.

### Key Content:
- **Blessedness**:  
  - True blessedness comes from knowing and following Christ.  
  - Old Testament figures like David and Isaiah longed to see Christ but did not.  
  - Blessedness is attained through faith, obedience, and inner purity.  

- **Love for God and Neighbor**:  
  - The lawyer asks, "What must I do to inherit eternal life?"  
  - Jesus responds: Love God fully (heart, soul, mind, strength) and neighbor as yourself.  
  - Loving God means desiring His glory above all; loving neighbor means seeking their spiritual and physical good.  

- **The Good Samaritan Parable**:  
  - A man is robbed and left half-dead; a priest and Levite ignore him.  
  - A Samaritan (symbolizing Christ) shows mercy, binds his wounds, and cares for him.  
  - Jesus teaches that true neighborliness is shown through mercy, regardless of social or religious barriers.  

- **Practical Application**:  
  - Christians must actively love others, not just in word but in deed.  
  - The Church (innkeeper) is called to care for the wounded (sinners) with Christ’s resources.  

### Key Quote:  
> "Go and do likewise." (Luke 10:37)
