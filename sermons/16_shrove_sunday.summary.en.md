This summary captures key points from Jan Hus's sermon for Shrove Sunday, focusing on Christ's passion and the spiritual blindness of humanity. The original text is a Czech homily drawing from Luke 18:31-43, where Jesus predicts His suffering and heals a blind beggar.  

### Key Content:  
- **Christ’s Voluntary Suffering**:  
  - Jesus foretells His betrayal, mockery, scourging, and crucifixion to His disciples (Luke 18:31-33).  
  - His sacrifice is framed as an act of obedience to God the Father and love for humanity.  

- **Spiritual Blindness**:  
  - The blind beggar symbolizes humanity’s spiritual darkness, needing Christ’s light (John 14:6: "I am the way").  
  - Four marks of human brokenness: blindness (ignorance of God), weakness (inability to do good), error (straying from God’s path), and poverty (loss of grace).  

- **Call to Repentance**:  
  - Like the beggar, sinners must cry out, *"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"* (Luke 18:38).  
  - Jan Hus critiques clergy and laypeople who mock Christ’s teachings or prioritize worldly power over humility.  

- **Critique of Church Corruption**:  
  - Hus condemns greed, simony, and pride among clergy, linking these to the "poison" of worldly wealth (Luke 16:9: "unrighteous mammon").  
  - He contrasts Christ’s poverty with the opulence of prelates, citing Matthew 19:21 ("Sell all you have").  

- **Healing Through Faith**:  
  - The beggar’s physical healing mirrors the soul’s restoration by faith (Luke 18:42: *"Your faith has made you well"*).  
  - Hus urges listeners to seek *"the light of eternal glory"* rather than temporal pleasures.  

### Key Quote:  
> *"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"* (Luke 18:38).
