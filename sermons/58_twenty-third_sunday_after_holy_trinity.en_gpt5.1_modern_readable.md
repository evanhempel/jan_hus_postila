# Twenty-Third Sunday After Holy Trinity

Saint Matthew writes in chapter 22, verses 15–21:

“At that time the scribes went away and took counsel together how they might trap Jesus in his words. And they sent their disciples to him, together with Herod’s followers, saying, ‘Teacher, we know that you are a man of truth, that you teach the way of God in truth, and that you are not concerned about anyone’s status, for you do not look at people’s faces. So tell us, what do you think: is it right to pay tax to Caesar or not?’ But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said, ‘Why are you testing me, you hypocrites? Show me the coin used for the tax.’ And they brought him a coin. Jesus said to them, ‘Whose image is this, and what inscription?’ They said to him, ‘Caesar’s.’ Then he said to them, ‘So give to Caesar the things that belong to Caesar, and to God the things that belong to God.’”

A. This holy reading shows us the malice of the scribes. That malice has several branches.

The first branch is that they could not bear true teaching and rebuke from the Lord Jesus. Because of that, they grew angry and went away from Christ. As the reading says at the beginning: “At that time”—that is, on the Monday after Palm Sunday—when Jesus had told them many good things that were against their evil deeds, “then the scribes went away.” So the first branch of their evil is this: they were impatient under true rebuke.

The second branch is their evil counsel. They took counsel together about how to dishonor the righteous One. That is why the reading says, “they took counsel how to trap Jesus in his words.”

The third branch of their evil is their conspiracy with the pagans against the righteous. The reading says, “They sent their disciples to him with the Herodians,” that is, with Herod’s soldiers and attendants.

The fourth branch of their evil is their hypocrisy, covered over with flattery. They say: “Teacher, we know that you are a man of truth, that you teach the way of God in truth, and that you do not care about anyone’s status, for you do not look at people’s faces.” Look: their words are praise, but their hearts are full of unbelief. They do what a butcher does to an ox: with one hand he strokes its forehead, and in the other he holds the axe and plans its death. They had murder in their hearts, and Herod’s servants came armed to seize him. In this way the malice of the scribes had grown.

B. Now in this reading we also see several things about the Lord Jesus, showing that he is truly God.

First, we see that he knows the evil hidden in human hearts. The reading says, “Jesus, knowing their wickedness”—or their evil.

Second, we see that Jesus rejects empty praise. He says to those false flatterers, “Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?” He answers them rightly: he does not deny the true things they say about him, yet he answers sharply against their evil hearts. They flatter in order to destroy; he rebukes in order to save. For, as Saint John Chrysostom says, it is better to have an angry God than a compassionate man.

Third, in Christ we see just and wise teaching in his answer to their question—an answer that protects both God’s honor and Caesar’s tax. For he says to them, “Give—or keep on giving—to Caesar the things that belong to Caesar, and to God the things that belong to God.”

So listen again to the reading.

“Then they went away”—that is, away from Christ—“and took counsel with Herod’s servants.” Saint John Chrysostom asks: Why did they do this? The reading itself answers: they “took counsel how they might trap Jesus in his words,” since they had not been able to trap him in his deeds and so prepare him for death. For Saint Luke says in chapter 20, verse 19: “The chief priests and teachers of the law wanted at that very hour to lay their hands on him, but they were afraid of the people.” So, as our reading says, “they sent to him” their disciples.

In Latin it says *mittunt*—“they send.” But because that form does not sound quite right in Czech, and because it is true that they “sent” them, I have simply said, “They sent.” And I want always, as far as I can, to put things in the truest and clearest way, so that the full truth remains, and believing souls can easily understand.

The reading says, “they sent to him”—that is, to test him—“their disciples.” They sent the less-known ones, because the scribes themselves had already often been rebuked by Jesus. They thought he would not be on his guard against their disciples as he would against them, and that, if he had to rebuke anyone, he would rebuke the disciples less harshly than he would the scribes themselves.

“And they sent them with the Herodians”—that is, with Herod’s soldiers and attendants. The disciples were to trap him with his words, and the soldiers were to seize him in his body. The spiritual leaders joined with the pagans against Jesus: the religious leaders were to bear witness against him, and the secular powers were to catch him and murder him.

In Latin it says *cum herodianis*. I do not know a better way to say that in Czech than “with Herod’s followers.” If you wish, you may say “with Herod’s party.” And because both groups were wicked, Saint Luke says in chapter 11 that “they sent spies, who pretended to be righteous, to catch him in what he said, and then to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor”—that is, to secular power—to death.

Wanting to bring him down by flattery, they say, “Teacher, we know that you are a man of truth.” In Latin it says *verax*. I do not know how to say that better than “truth-speaking”—one who loves the truth and is ready to confess it. So they say, “Teacher”—that is, in wisdom—“we know that you are a man of truth,” meaning, you like to speak the truth and do not lie, “and that you teach the way of God”—that is, the way by which people go to God, the way God himself has set out—“in truth,” meaning: you teach rightly which way people must go to be saved—the way of God’s commandments and counsels and the way of true repentance.

“And you are not concerned about anyone.” That is, as the explanation says: you are not afraid of those in high position, and so you are not afraid of anyone in such a way that you would wrongly hide the truth. “For you do not look at people’s faces”—that is, you speak the truth directly, to great and small alike, no matter their rank.

“Therefore”—meaning, since you are like this, as we say—“tell us what you think: Is it right to pay tax to Caesar, or not?”

We hear, then, that although these men were wicked, they were still forced—even under the mask of hypocrisy—to give good testimony about Christ. They did wrong in their intention, because they gave this testimony with an evil purpose. Yet in that testimony they confess that Christ is a teacher and wise, that he is truthful, that he truly teaches the truth, that he does not turn aside from the path of truth out of fear, and that he does not show favoritism.

Oh, if only we would follow this Teacher in these things: then we would live rightly, we would confess the truth, and we would not show favoritism. But sadly, we have wandered far from Christ’s path here, especially in the matter of accepting people’s persons. About this Saint Jerome says that among all the sins of priests, the greatest is that they accept persons. So they cast aside the righteous and the poor, and they exalt the unjust and the rich. So says Jerome. What it means to “accept persons” I have already explained in another sermon before this one.

The tempters go on: “Therefore,” meaning, since you are such a man as we describe, whom we call ‘teacher’ and praise as your friends, “tell us what you think: Is it right to pay tax to Caesar, or not?”

This question first arose at the time of Christ’s birth. As Saint Luke writes in chapter 2, verses 1 and 3, Caesar Augustus ordered that all the world should be registered, so that each person should go to his own town to be written down and pay money to Caesar. Because the land of the Jews lies in the middle of the world, the registration first took place in that land. When Mary the virgin went up for that registration, she gave birth there to our Savior, Jesus Christ.

Already at that time the question arose: Is it right for the Jews—especially for the priests—to pay a tax, that is, a set sum of money, to Caesar, or is it not right? There was a man called Judas the Galilean who said that it was not right. His argument was that it was not fitting for the Jews to acknowledge any lord on earth except God, since they were God’s people.

With this same thought in mind the bishops, teachers, priests, and scribes said to Jesus—John chapter 8, verse 33: “We are the descendants of Abraham and have never been slaves to anyone.” So many people sided with Judas the Galilean, believing it was not right to pay tax to Caesar. Others held that it was right to pay tax, because Caesar was lord and defended them and the common good.

Because, in that question, no one could please both sides, no matter which side he took, they used this old, inflammatory question to try to bring Christ into Caesar’s hatred. Their intention was this: if Jesus said it was right to pay tax to Caesar, then all the Jewish people would be against him. But if he said, “It is not right to pay tax to Caesar,” then Caesar’s soldiers would at once seize him and hand him over to the governor, as Saint Luke says in chapter 20, verse 20.

But human cleverness cannot overcome the wisdom of God. So the reading says, “Jesus, knowing their evil”—or “their wickedness.” In this he showed himself to be God, because he recognized their wicked intention. I say “wickedness” because, although they asked a good, true question, they did not ask it with an honest desire for good but in order to ensnare him. So they had *nequitia* in their hearts—that is the Latin word; if you call it “evil,” you do not sin.

“Jesus, knowing their evil, said, ‘Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?’” With these words the Savior exposes their evil and strikes down their flattery. He reveals their intention: “Why are you testing me?” You do not want to be taught, you do not want to know the truth; you only want to catch me in my words and deliver me to death.

Here Titus comments: “Why are you testing me?”—as if Christ said: You test me with your words; obey me with your deeds. You have taken up Caesar’s service. You have taken the things that belong to him. Therefore give him tax, and give God reverence. God does not ask for money; God asks for faith. So far Titus.

“Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?” You have covered up your evil and your great desire for my death before the people with flattering speech. Hypocrites, who, while you press and praise me, ask a useful question and speak truth, yet you lie in your hearts, for there is something different in your mouth than in your intention. You call me teacher and faithful master with your lips, but in your hearts you count me as a deceiver.

So Christ does not flatter them; instead he calls them plainly what they are—hypocrites. And a hypocrite is someone who is evil, yet wants to appear good before people; he wants others to think well of him, while he thinks and says or does something different inside.

These hypocrites behaved just like that. To them Christ says, “Show me the coin used for the tax.” Saint Luke says (Luke 20:24): “Show me a coin—whose image and inscription does it have?” Matthew in Latin uses the word *numisma*, and Luke uses *denarium*. This was the coin they had to give every year to Caesar; on it was Caesar’s image and inscription.

“They brought him a coin,” that is, for him to look at. “And Jesus said to them, ‘Whose image is this, and what inscription?’”—meaning, on the coin. “They said to him, ‘Caesar’s’”—the image and also the inscription. Saint Jerome says that this was Tiberius Caesar, under whom Christ was crucified. “Caesar” was the title for every Roman emperor, from the first who bore that name.

When they confessed that the image on the coin and the inscription around it were Caesar’s, he said to them: “Therefore give—or keep giving—to Caesar the things that belong to Caesar”—that is, money, taxes, and obedience, because by these things you confess that you are under his authority—“and to God the things that belong to God.” The things that belong to God and are fitting for him are obedience, praise, prayer, and love above all other things.

He divided their question rightly and wisely, wronging neither Caesar nor the Jews. The hypocrites had thought there was no way he could escape without being defeated. But Matthew says that when they heard this answer, “they were amazed. Then they left him and went away.” They were amazed that he had overcome them so completely that they could not reply to him. By the truth he tied their mouths shut. He answered them according to what they deserved, in such a way that he answered their question, but not fully according to their wording, as they wanted. They wanted him to say clearly either, “It is right to pay tax to Caesar,” or, “It is not right to pay tax to Caesar.” He did not take either side openly, yet he answered in such a way that they could not accuse him of doing wrong either to Caesar or to them.

Yet, being taught by their father the devil, on the third day after this questioning they brought a charge against him before Pilate. They accused him, saying, as Luke 23:2 records: “We found this man forbidding us to pay taxes to Caesar.” Wicked liars! In their hearts and on their tongues they still held the same plan by which they had hoped to bring him to death.

And although our dear Savior himself paid tax to Caesar, not only for himself but also for Peter—as Saint Matthew tells us in chapter 17, verse 27—and although in this reading he also judges that the Jewish priests and bishops should pay tax to Caesar, yet today’s priests do not want to accept either Christ’s right answer or his example. They do not want, out of their great wealth, to pay tax to their earthly lords when it is for the common good.

Look at this: our poor Savior, who had no estates and no worldly lordship, still willingly paid tax to a pagan Caesar, to give us an example that we should be subject to the secular power in this matter. Therefore Saint John Chrysostom says: “If you reject the world by the example of Christ, you will not be obliged to any secular prince. Let this phrase teach you: *Date quae sunt Caesaris Caesari, et quae sunt Dei Deo*—‘Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and to God the things that are God’s.’” So far the golden mouth.

And Saint Ambrose says: “If you do not want to owe anything to Caesar, then do not possess worldly goods.” So says Ambrose. But I think that not many of today’s priests will gladly accept either the example of their Savior or his command, by which he orders that we give to Caesar what is his. Nor will they quickly accept those two holy sayings which declare that whoever does not want to pay tax to Caesar should not have worldly goods. For there are now very few priests who are not eager for wealth—just as the prophet Jeremiah foretold when he said (Jeremiah 8:10): “From the least to the greatest, and from the priest to the prophet [that is, the preacher], all of them are greedy for gain.”

Saint Peter also prophesied, saying in his second epistle, chapter 2, verses 1–3: “There were false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you… Many will follow their sexual immorality, and because of them the way of truth will be slandered. And in their greed they will exploit you with fabricated words.” Saint Peter. And Saint Paul says in 2 Timothy 3:1–2: “In the last days perilous times will come. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, arrogant, proud.” And if it is not so, then do not believe the Scriptures.

I know that rich, greedy priests will hardly accept this message, because wealth has so attached itself to them—not perhaps to their hands, but to their desires—that they cannot easily let it go so that they might pay tax, and especially so that they might not rule as worldly lords.

I notice that Christ’s command troubles them deeply—the command in Luke 22:25–26: “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them… but you are not to be like that.” Because they have broken that command, this word also troubles them: “Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s.” It troubles them so much that those who preach this truth in sermons or in schools they call heretics. But it cannot be otherwise: if Christ, who both commanded this and fulfilled it in his own life, is not the heretic, then those who oppose him must be the heretics.

Our dear Christ did no evil, and no deceit was found in his mouth. Therefore the mouths that speak against Christ’s command to his priests are lying mouths. Those are Christ’s true followers who, humbly and without lordship, in a right spirit, avoiding sin, preach the word of God, and, being made poor, are freed from Caesar’s tax.

Just as the hypocrites could not answer Christ’s word when he said, “Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s,” so those who grumble against the preachers of Christ’s truth will in the end fall silent, even before people. For when Christ said, “Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and to God the things that are God’s,” Saint Luke tells us in chapter 20, verse 26, that “they were not able to catch him in what he said in front of the people; and amazed at his answer, they became silent.”

How then can today’s priests speak against Christ’s word before the people—this word: “Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar”? Or this word which he speaks to priests (Matthew 20:26): “Do not lord it over others!” Or this (Matthew 10:9): “Do not accumulate gold and silver for yourselves!” We will understand, when we die, what Christ means by these words.
