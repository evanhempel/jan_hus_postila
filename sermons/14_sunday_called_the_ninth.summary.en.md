This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon based on Matthew chapter 20, verses 1-16, commonly refered to as the "Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard." Jan Hus explains the spiritual meaning behind the parable, emphasizing God's grace, fairness, and the eternal reward awaiting faithful workers.

### Key Points:
- **The Vineyard as the Church**: Jan Hus uses the vineyard to symbolize the Church, where God calls workers (believers) from all ages.
  - Five periods (ages) are represented by different hours of the day: morning (first age), third hour (second age), sixth hour (third age), ninth hour (fourth age), and the eleventh hour (fifth age).
- **Equal Reward**: Despite working different lengths of time, all faithful workers receive the same reward—eternal bliss.
- **God’s Grace and Fairness**: Jan Hus emphasizes that salvation is not earned by merit but granted by God's grace. The parable highlights God’s justice and mercy.
- **Warning Against Complaints**: Those who labor longer should not envy those who join later, as God’s reward is based on His grace, not human effort.
- **Call to Action**: Jan Hus urges believers to work diligently in God’s vineyard regardless of their stage in life or the time they’ve spent in faith.

### Key Quote:
> "For many are called, but few are chosen."  
> *(Matthew 20:16)*
