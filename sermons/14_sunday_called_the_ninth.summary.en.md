title: Sunday Called The Ninth
---

This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon based on Matthew chapter 20, verses 1-16, commonly refered to as the "Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard." Jan Hus explains the spiritual meaning behind the parable, emphasizing God's grace, fairness, and the eternal reward awaiting faithful workers.

### Key Points:
- **The Vineyard as the Church**: Jan Hus uses the vineyard to symbolize the Church, where God calls workers (believers) from all ages.
  - Five periods (ages) are represented by different hours of the day: morning (first age), third hour (second age), sixth hour (third age), ninth hour (fourth age), and the eleventh hour (fifth age).
- **Equal Reward**: Despite working different lengths of time, all faithful workers receive the same reward—eternal bliss.
- **God’s Grace and Fairness**: Jan Hus emphasizes that salvation is not earned by merit but granted by God's grace. The parable highlights God’s justice and mercy.
- **Warning Against Complaints**: Those who labor longer should not envy those who join later, as God’s reward is based on His grace, not human effort.
- **Call to Action**: Jan Hus urges believers to work diligently in God’s vineyard regardless of their stage in life or the time they’ve spent in faith.

### Key Quote:
> "For many are called, but few are chosen."  
> *(Matthew 20:16)*

**Translator's Note on the Title**

This sermon is headed in the original Czech as *Neděle, jenž slove Devietnik* ("Sunday which is called Devietnik"). "Devietnik" (an archaic form of *devátník*) literally means "the Ninth" or "Ninth Sunday."

In the late medieval Bohemian liturgical calendar, this name refers to **Septuagesima Sunday** – the ninth Sunday before Easter (counted in a traditional manner common in Slavic churches) and the first of the three pre-Lenten Sundays. It is not a continuation of the numbered Sundays after Christmas, but a distinct Sunday with its own traditional name, marking the beginning of the preparatory season before Lent.

The apparent interruption in the post-Christmas numbering occurs because the number of Sundays after Epiphany/Christmas varies each year depending on the date of Easter. In years when Easter is early, Septuagesima arrives before a full sequence of post-Epiphany Sundays can be observed. The title has therefore been retained as a close rendering of the original, reflecting the historical Czech naming practice rather than modern liturgical terminology.
