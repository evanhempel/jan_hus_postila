title: Church Consecration Reading
---

This summary condenses Jan Hus's sermon on the story of Zacchaeus (Luke 19:1-10), preached for a church consecration. It highlights Christ's mercy, true repentance, and the foolish grumbling of critics.

### Key Points:
1. **Purpose of the Reading**  
   - Chosen for church consecration because:  
     - It mentions a "house" (Zacchaeus' home) where salvation came through Christ's visit.  
     - It features Zacchaeus, a repentant sinner, encouraging others to seek forgiveness.  

2. **Zacchaeus’ Character**  
   - A "chief tax collector" (Luke 19:2), openly sinful yet wealthy.  
   - His small stature symbolizes spiritual humility amid sin.  

3. **Seeking Christ**  
   - Zacchaeus climbs a sycamore tree (a symbol of the Cross) to see Jesus, overcoming obstacles like:  
     - Worldly distractions.  
     - Crowds (representing sin or societal barriers).  

4. **Christ’s Response**  
   - Jesus calls Zacchaeus by name, dines with him, and declares salvation for his household (Luke 19:5-9).  
   - Critics grumble, but Jesus defends His mission to save sinners (Luke 19:7, 10).  

5. **True Repentance**  
   - Zacchaeus demonstrates repentance by:  
     - Giving half his wealth to the poor.  
     - Restoring fourfold to those he defrauded (Exodus 22:1).  

6. **Broader Lessons**  
   - Christ’s humility: He became "Son of Man" to seek the lost (Luke 19:10).  
   - Warning against hypocrisy: Religious leaders criticized Jesus for associating with sinners.
