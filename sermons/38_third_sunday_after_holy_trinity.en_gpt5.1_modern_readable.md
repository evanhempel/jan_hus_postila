# Third Sunday After Holy Trinity  

From St Luke, chapter 15, verses 1–10  

At that time, public sinners and other sinners began to draw near to Jesus, with a real desire for good, and in their very bodies, to hear him and so be changed. But the teachers and experts in the Law grumbled out of envy. They said, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them,” as if to say: he receives them kindly and so acts against the Law.  

Jesus, wanting to teach them and drive out from them the error of their grumbling, spoke this parable:  

“Which one of you who has a hundred sheep, and loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it? And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors and says to them, ‘Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost!’ I tell you, in the same way there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, more than over ninety-nine righteous people who do not need repentance.  

“Or what woman, who has ten coins and loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house—turning things upside down where she hopes she might find the coin—and search carefully until she finds it? And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors and says, ‘Rejoice with me, because I have found the coin that I lost.’ In the same way, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”

**A.** This holy reading shows us the great mercy of our Savior: that he not only calls sinners to himself, but also teaches them, eats with them, and defends them from their accusers.  

Therefore St Gregory says: “You have heard in the holy reading, my dearest brothers, that sinners—even public, open sinners—came to our Redeemer not only to speak with him but also to eat with him. They were received. And when the teachers of the Law saw this, they were angry.” So far Gregory.  

From this reading we can notice four things:  

1. The truly beneficial turning of sinners, for it says, “Public sinners drew near to Jesus.”  
2. The cruel wickedness of the teachers of the Law, because they murmured against the Savior.  
3. The great mercy of our Savior, that he receives sinners.  
4. The great joy of all the angels over the repentance of even one sinner.  

On the first point St Luke says: “Public sinners drew near to Jesus.” Here you should know, as St Bede says, that “public sinners” are those who hold certain offices or trades where it is very hard to remain without sin. So tax-collectors were called “public sinners,” as St Matthew writes about himself (Matthew 9:9): that when Jesus saw a man named Matthew, a known public sinner, he said to him, “Follow me.”  

In the same way, merchants or market-dealers, reeves and judges, executioners and officers can be called public sinners—though they can be good—when they do in their office what is required of them according to God’s command.  

But according to the word itself *publicanus*—in Czech “zjevný hřiešník,” an open sinner—is anyone who sins openly in front of people and is not ashamed of his sin, like an open money-lender charging usury. Such a person was the open sinner Zacchaeus, into whose house Jesus came and whose sins he forgave when he repented, as St Luke writes (Luke 19:9).  

So thieves, prostitutes, gamblers, notorious dancers and festival dancing-women, and all who openly sin in front of people are public sinners.  

And also priests who openly practice simony, hold many benefices, and keep concubines—these are even worse than pimps. Why? Because they break a second vow made to God, they corrupt and disgrace the priestly state, they lead others astray by their example, and though they know the Scriptures, they act against them.  

May the merciful Lord Jesus give grace that such men also may draw near to him, as those public sinners drew near to Jesus—both the open sinners and the “sinners,” that is, the hidden ones, whose sins were concealed from people. And these hidden sinners can also be very great sinners.

**B.** And they did not draw near to him for nothing or from malice, as the teachers, priests, and lawyers did, but, as St Luke says, “in order to hear him.” Their drawing near was truly good, because their purpose was good: they wanted to listen, they believed in their hearts, and in their deeds they fulfilled the will of Jesus. They came as sick people to a doctor and found health. Having been public sinners, they left their sins and were made righteous. Being dead, they came to the one who gives life to others and were made alive by him.  

So who, being sick, would not go to such a doctor, who heals every disease and raises the dead in soul and in body?  

O merciful Jesus! You are the doctor and I am sick. You are merciful and I am miserable. Have mercy on me and heal me! You are the doctor who came down from heaven and healed us who were sick in soul. You yourself say that the healthy do not need a physician, but the sick do—and that you came for them, to heal them. You are the friend of sinners who repent of their sins, about whom St Luke says: “Public sinners and other sinners drew near to Jesus in order to hear him.”  

So then, you sinners—come near to Jesus with me, a sinner. For St Ambrose says in *Lib. de virg.*: “Every soul, draw near to Christ, for Christ is everything for us. Do you desire healing for your wounds? He is the doctor. Are you burning with fever? He is the spring. Are you burdened with evil? He is righteousness. Do you fear death? He is life. Do you desire heaven? He is the way. Do you fear darkness? He is light. Do you long for food? He is satisfaction.”  

That is Ambrose. And I will add: Do you desire teaching? He is the supreme Master. Do you desire help? He is the Lord and all-powerful defender. Are you sorrowful? He is eternal joy. Are you rejected by people here—especially by scholars and priests? He will receive you. For even his enemies, the teachers and the lawyers, bear witness that he receives sinners.  

The reading continues: “The teachers and the lawyers grumbled, saying, ‘This man receives sinners and eats with them.’” They grumbled, judging Christ as evil because he associated with sinners.  

If these grumblers had believed that Christ is the doctor who cannot be defiled in his soul by the sins of sinners, and if they had seen that Christ, knowing the God-ward intention of these public sinners, recognized that they desired to be healed in their souls—shown by the fact that they drew near to him in order to hear him—if they had believed this, they would not have grumbled.  

But because they did not believe, they grumbled, and fell into two errors. First, they considered themselves righteous, though they were proud and otherwise evil. Second, they considered Jesus to be sinful—yet he cannot be sinful—and they judged others to be sinners who by Jesus had already been made righteous.  

Yet, even while thinking evil, they spoke to us a comforting truth when they said, “Jesus receives sinners and eats with them.”

**C.** Why did our dear Savior want to associate with sinners in such a bodily, everyday way?  

It seems to me, first, that he did it to lead them out of their sins and to show that he is the Savior of sinners. As he himself says (Luke 19:10): “The Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.”  

Second, he associated with public sinners to shame the teachers, priests, and lawyers, and to draw them to faith and thus to salvation.  

Third, he associated with them to give an example to his representatives, that they too should, with care and without causing scandal to themselves or to others, associate with sinners for their improvement.  

But the lawyers did not see these reasons. With evil hearts, ready to judge wrongly, “they grumbled, saying, ‘This man receives sinners and eats with them.’”  

Yet the merciful Savior, because of their grumbling, did not abandon the sinners, nor stop associating with them. He did not seek their favor or praise, teaching us by this that when we are judged without cause, we should not be shaken, nor desire the favor of God’s opponents.  

St Paul did both things. About the first he says (1 Corinthians 4:3): “To me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you.” About the second he says (Galatians 1:10): “If I were still trying to please people [that is, evil people], I would not be a servant of Christ.”  

And in agreement with this, a certain writer in *Auctor V clav.* says: “I desire to please the good and to be hated by the evil, for it is their custom always to hate the good.”  

Therefore, whoever wants to please evil people, and does not rebuke their sins, according to the word of St Paul is not yet a servant of God. For the Savior says (Luke 21:17): “You will be hated by all”—that is, by all evil people—“because you will rebuke their sins.”  

And because dear Christ most sharply rebuked the teachers, priests, and lawyers—for they were most deserving of it—they hated him the most, and so murmured against him.  

But because his goodness never repays evil with evil, he chose instead to teach them that their grumbling was wrong. “He said to them this parable: ‘Which one of you who has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, does he not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it?’”  

As if he were saying: Each of you would do this if you lost one sheep—you would leave the others and go look for the lost one. “And when he finds it, he lays it”—the Latin says *inponit*, that is, he keeps putting it—“on his shoulders,” and so on.  

Therefore, O teachers and lawyers, since each of you would do this for a physical sheep, why should it not be fitting for me to seek the lost sheep—that is, the human being lost in sin—by associating with him, I who already have angels in heaven and have come down here for the sake of sinners?  

In this parable of Christ, he himself is the “man from among you”—that is, from the Jews—for he is of their line, as John 4:22 says: “Salvation,” that is, the Savior, “is from the Jews.”  

That man, Christ, had in his keeping from the Father God one hundred sheep. He had the whole company of angels, signified by the ninety-nine, and he had the human race, called the hundredth sheep. That sheep was lost through the sin of Adam and Eve.  

Because this man, Christ, was bound to the Father to watch over these sheep, he left the angelic flock, leaving it confirmed in heaven. That heaven is called “the wilderness” because of its solitude: first, because before the incarnation of the Son of God, only God himself with the angels was there; second, because before Christ’s ascension, no human had ever gone there; third, because there is much beautiful spiritual “wood,” green with virtues.  

The Son of God goes after that sheep that was lost: he leaves or forsakes created angelic nature in the sense that he does not take it upon himself, but he takes on human nature, so that he might be in unity of humanity with the lost sheep—being a human of such a kind that he could not sin in his own person, but could suffer for that sheep and redeem it, since it could not help itself or make satisfaction for itself.  

That is why the Son of God did not take upon himself the nature of angels, but he took humanity.  

Second, he did this so that the sheep—that is, the human—might recognize Christ as one of its own flock, a quiet lamb, bleating, who went to the slaughter in order to redeem that sheep from death.  

Third, he did it to exalt humanity through his incarnation.  

He found that sheep especially in the lowliness of the Virgin Mary, from whom he took his human nature. Joyfully and powerfully he laid it on his shoulders; and when he had finished the work for that sheep—seeking it with bloody tears on the Mount of Olives—“he came home,” on the day of his ascension to heaven, and “called together his friends and neighbors.”  

By “friends” he means holy people, whom he calls brothers, sisters, and even mother, saying (Matthew 12:50): “Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.” He has already called these friends to himself, saying to them (John 15:14): “You are my friends if you do what I command you.”  

By “neighbors,” who always dwell near him but are not in such close kinship as friends, he means the angels, with whom he is not bound in the same way as with humans by his incarnation. He calls them too and says to them: “Rejoice with me, because I have found the sheep that was lost”—now saved. “I tell you, in the same way there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents,” in the same way, that is, as a shepherd rejoices when he finds his lost sheep—“more than over ninety-nine righteous people who do not need repentance.”  

This can be understood like this: there is greater joy among the angels in heaven over the saved sheep—that is, over the whole human race that will finally be saved through repentance—than “over the ninety-nine righteous who do not need repentance,” that is, than over the whole company of the nine angelic choirs, who do not need repentance, because they have never sinned.  

It can also be understood of one individual penitent sinner: that the angels rejoice more over him than over ninety-nine righteous people who do not need repentance. For example, they have greater joy in heaven over the apostle Paul or over Mary Magdalene than over ninety-nine little children who do not need repentance because, after baptism, they committed no sin.  

Know that St Gregory speaks about this in this way:  

“We must notice, my brothers, why the Lord declares that there is greater joy in heaven over converted sinners than over righteous people who stand firm. On the one hand, we see this with our own eyes every day. Many who do not know themselves to have committed great sins, who do nothing obviously evil, who stand on the path of righteousness, do not hurry with zeal toward the heavenly homeland. They allow themselves more indulgence in earthly enjoyments because they have not fallen into gross sins, and they are often lazy in good works because they are sure they have not committed great sins.  

“But those who remember that they have done shameful things are set on fire, through the pain in their hearts, with love for God. They advance greatly in great virtues, they desire all the hard struggles of holy combat, they leave all worldly things, they avoid honors, they rejoice when they suffer wrong, they burn with desire and hurry toward the heavenly homeland. Because they recognize they once went astray from God, they repair the losses of the past by the gains of the present. Therefore, there is greater joy in heaven over a converted sinner than over a righteous person who stands.  

“For even a commander in battle loves more that warrior who, after once fleeing, returns and then fiercely presses or strikes the enemy, than the one who never fled but also never did any great deed. Likewise, a farmer loves more that field which, after once being overgrown with thorns, later brings abundant fruitful crops, than another field which has never had thorns, but never yields a plentiful harvest.”  

So far Gregory.  

Then the Savior goes on: “Or what woman who has ten coins and loses one coin, does she not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?”  

St Gregory says: “The one who portrays himself as the shepherd seeking the lost sheep portrays himself also in the woman, for he is God and he is divine Wisdom. And because an image is stamped on a coin, the woman lost a coin when the human being, made in the image of God, turned away from the likeness of his Creator by sinning. But the woman lights a lamp when divine Wisdom [the Son of God] shows itself in humanity.” So far Gregory.  

We can also understand it like this: Christ gives us an example using a woman: if she lost a coin—understand, a coin of real value, like a piece of gold or a large silver coin—hoping she might find it in her house, she would light a lamp. The Latin text says *lucerna*—a vessel of leather, cloth, or some other material that holds a light so that the wind cannot blow it out. In our language we might call it a “lamp,” because the wind can do “nic” or nothing to the light in it.  

So the woman, lighting the lamp in that holder, would search for the coin in the house and would turn the house upside down, that is, move and overturn the things in the house that might hinder her from finding the lost coin, until she found it. And when she found it, she would call her neighbors to rejoice with her—and perhaps they would drink it up together!  

In this, Christ, according to St Gregory’s explanation, compares himself to the woman, as if he were saying to the lawyers: You ought to rejoice with me that I am seeking lost sinners like a woman seeking her lost coin, and that I have already found many. But you, like evil neighbors, are jealous of this and grumble.  

The meaning of this parable is that the woman is the Son of God, that is, divine Wisdom, in this story. The nine coins are the company of rational creatures—the nine angelic choirs—and the tenth is the human race. All these “coins” belong to the Son of God, by whom they were created and who stamped on them the image of God. The tenth, lost coin is the human being ruined by sin.  

The woman lights the lamp in the lamp-holder when divine Wisdom shows itself in humanity. For St Gregory says: “Truly, the lamp-holder with light in it is divinity clothed in flesh (*in testa*); and that light in its vessel is the Godhead in the body. About this vessel of his body Wisdom itself says (Psalm 22:16): ‘My strength has dried up like a potsherd.’”  

So far Gregory.  

The wind of priestly envy and malice could not blow out this light—that is, the Godhead in humanity.  

This woman “turns the house upside down” when divine Wisdom, taking on human nature, so exalts the human being that, though he was the lowest creature—between angels and below angels—now in Christ he is exalted above the angels. And because of this, the angels rejoice more over redeemed humanity than over all the angelic choirs; for there is no error if we say that Christ the man surpasses all the angels.  

Also, “turning the house upside down,” as St Gregory says, means that conscience is turned and brought back from sins by the fear of God. He says: “The house is turned upside down when the conscience is disturbed by knowledge of sin. For an evil mind, unless it is first shaken by fear, will not be cleansed from habitual sin. Therefore, only when the house is turned upside down will the lost coin be found. For when the conscience of a person is troubled, the image of the Creator is renewed in that person.”  

So far Gregory.  

Thus the woman—that is, divine Wisdom—having lit the lamp, that is, having made the Godhead known in humanity, sought for thirty-three years the lost coin: the human being whose divine image had been damaged by sin.  

She “turns the house upside down” entirely when, by her power and gracious visitation, she turns the conscience of the sinful person back again to God’s image. And she calls to this found coin her friends and neighbors—that is, her holy angels—as St Gregory explains, saying: “Rejoice with me, because I have found the coin that I lost.”  

“In the same way, I tell you, there will be joy before the angels of God”—there you see that the angels are meant by the friends and neighbors—“over one sinner who repents.” And here you see that the lost, then found, coin signifies the repentant human being, over whom the angels of God—but not the devils—rejoice.  

So who, being a sinner, would not repent when he hears this from his own Bishop and King—his Savior—who associates with open sinners, kindly receives them, and declares that the angels of God rejoice with him when a sinner repents of his sins?  

But notice carefully what he says: “There will be joy before the angels of God over one sinner who does repentance.” He does not say “who only thinks about repentance or talks about repentance.” Many think about repenting and talk about it, but do not actually repent, because they do not avoid sin and do not truly grieve for past sins.  

To repent of sins is to grieve for past sins, to guard oneself against them in future, and to endure what must be borne for past sins.  

Let us do such repentance, my dearest brothers, for the sake of God’s command. For Christ says (Matthew 4:17): “Repent,” so that you may escape eternal condemnation. For Christ says (Luke 13:5): “Unless you repent, you will all perish.”  

For the sake of gaining eternal joy, for escape from dreadful shame, and for the joy of the angels of God, let us repent—with the help of our Lord Jesus Christ.
