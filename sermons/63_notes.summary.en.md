## Summary of Jan Hus's Postilla

This is a summary of the historical and editorial context surrounding Jan Hus's "Postilla," a collection of sermons on Sunday gospel readings. The original text has undergone multiple editions and translations since its first printing in 1563.  

### Key Points:
- **Early Editions**:
  - First printed in 1563 in Nuremberg, titled "Postilla svaté paměti M. Jana Husi."
  - Subsequent editions in 1564 (unknown location) and 1592 (Nuremberg).
- **Modern Editions**:
  - Karel Jaromír Erben published a critical edition (1865-1868) based on manuscripts, including the Horčičkův manuscript (1414).
  - Václav Flajšhans produced a modernized Czech version in 1900.
  - Multiple 20th-century editions followed, including translations and adaptations.
- **Manuscripts**:
  - Three primary manuscripts were used for Erben's edition, with gaps filled from other sources.
  - Additional fragments and translations (Latin/German) exist but lack comprehensive study.
- **Editorial Choices**:
  - This edition retains Erben's text but adds a glossary of archaic terms.
  - Biblical citations are cross-referenced with the Vulgate and Kralická Bible (1613).
  - Footnotes clarify textual variations and historical censorship.

> **Key Quote**:  
> *"Celé toto místo o svědectví S. Augustina v rukopisu musejním přetrženo jest hustě černidlem, aby se nemohlo čísti."*  
> *(Erben notes how parts of Hus's text were deliberately obscured by later censors.)*
