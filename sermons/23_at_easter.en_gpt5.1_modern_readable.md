# At Easter

Saint Mark writes in chapter 16, verses 1–7:  
“When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so they could go and anoint Jesus. Very early, on the first day after the Sabbath, they came to the tomb at sunrise. And they were saying to one another, ‘Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb for us?’ But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away—it was very large. Entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were afraid. He said to them, ‘Do not be afraid. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. Look—the place where they laid him. But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you into Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you.’”

This holy reading shows what happened on this very day after Christ’s resurrection from the dead, which we celebrate today, so that—being thankful for his rising from the dead—we may also look forward to our own resurrection, and, once glorified, rejoice with him forever. For, as St. Gregory says in today’s sermon, there are two kinds of life: one mortal, the other immortal. We know the first; we did not know the second. For truly, one life ends in death, and the other begins with resurrection. Therefore, when the Reconciler of God and humanity, Christ Jesus, came, he took on the one life and revealed the other. He took on the one life by dying, and he showed the other by rising from the dead. If he had only promised us who know the mortal life that there would be a resurrection from the dead, but had not clearly shown it, who would have believed his promise? So he became truly human, appeared in the flesh, chose to die willingly, and rose gloriously from the dead. In this way, by his own example, he visibly demonstrated what he had promised us as our reward.

Someone might object: “It was only right that he rose from the dead; because he is God, death could not hold him.” So, to teach our foolishness and to strengthen our weak faith, he did not want his own resurrection alone to be enough of an example for us. For though he himself truly died at that time, he did not rise alone. It is written in Matthew 27:52: “Many bodies of the saints who had died were raised.” So every excuse for unbelief is taken away, so that no one can say, “A mere human should not hope for what the God-man did in his own body.” Look, we know that together with God, human beings also rose, and we do not doubt that they were only human. Therefore, if we are members of our Redeemer, let us hope for the very same thing in ourselves that has already happened in our Head.

All this St. Gregory teaches, proving that we, too, must rise from the dead, since Christ, our Head, not only rose himself, but also raised others with him, to confirm us all the more that we will surely rise.

And this resurrection is what we celebrate today on this great holy feast, remembering in the reading what happened: that three holy women—Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Mary Salome, that is, the daughter of the man who was the husband of St. Anne and was called Salomas—came to the tomb. So in this reading we have Mary Magdalene and two Marys, the sisters of the Virgin Mary. According to Jewish custom they wanted to honor the dead body of Jesus. So, as the Gospel says, “Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Mary Salome bought spices so that, when they came, they might anoint Jesus,” following Jewish custom and showing love to the dead one whom they had loved while he was alive.

Our dear Savior arranged it so that, in this ministry of spices, Mary Magdalene would be named first, to show that spiritual love is more pleasing to him than merely bodily relationship. For these two other Marys were aunts of Christ according to the flesh, and Mary Magdalene was not so closely related to him by blood. Yet here he places her first, and later, when he rose from the dead, he appeared to her before he appeared to others, as St. Mark shows in 16:9: “Jesus, having risen from the dead on the first day, appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.” In this he gives comfort to repentant sinners: if they repent fervently and love him greatly, they can even surpass others in the favor of our Savior Jesus Christ.

The reading continues: “Very early on the first day,” that is, the first day of the week, “after the Sabbath,” which is today, “they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.” Understand that these holy women, because of the Jewish feast day, did not prepare the spices on the Sabbath itself but kept quiet. Toward evening, after the Jewish feast was completed, they prepared the spices, and then today—Sunday, which was called the first day after the Jewish feast—they finally came to the tomb. As St. Jerome says, they had already been near the tomb in the evening and again at night before sunrise. In this way you can bring the Gospel accounts into harmony. For St. Matthew (28:1) says that toward evening, which begins the first day after the Sabbath—that is, from sunset, as the Jews count the day—Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the tomb; that was yesterday evening. And now St. Mark (16:2) says they came “very early, at sunrise,” meaning when the day was already showing itself with its rays.

On the way they doubted who would roll the stone away from the tomb for them, and so they all said together, “Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb for us?” But God, who does not delay to help those who have a good desire, commanded an angel to roll it away. Not because Christ could not come out while the stone was still in place, since he had come forth from the womb of the Virgin Mary without breaking it, and had entered to his disciples through closed doors. Rather, the angel rolled the stone away to terrify the soldiers who were guarding the tomb, and to show the women that the tomb was empty, and to tell them that he had risen and would go ahead of them into Galilee.

So when the women came to that cave or chamber where the tomb was, “they looked up and saw that the stone had been rolled away.” And to show that their earlier conversation had not been pointless, and that they truly could not have rolled it away by themselves, St. Mark adds: “and the stone was very large.” The bishops and priests had very carefully blocked up that tomb, so that the disciples would not easily steal him away!

“And when the women went into the tomb”—that is, into the cave where the tomb was—“they saw a young man on the right side,” that is, an angel in the form of a young man, “dressed in a white robe, and they were afraid,” because the body of Christ was not there and the tomb was empty. But the good angel, as a faithful messenger of God—acting quite differently from the devil—comforted the women, saying, “Do not be afraid! You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here now in the tomb according to the body, though according to his divinity he is everywhere. Look—the place where they laid him.” That is, look at the place where they had laid him before; now it is empty. “But go,” he says, “and tell his disciples”—all of them together—“and Peter” in particular, so that because of his denial of his Master he will not fall into despair, but, turning back, will strengthen the others in faith.

Here St. Gregory says there is a question: Why, when the angel named the apostles in general, did he mention Peter specifically by name? He answers: Because if the angel had not named him especially, then Peter—because he had denied his Master—would not have dared to come among the disciples. Therefore he is named personally, so that he will not despair because of his denial.

Then the angel says: “He is going ahead of you into Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you.” St. Gregory explains that *Galilea* means “passing over.” For our Redeemer has already passed from suffering to resurrection, from death to life, from torment to glory, and after his resurrection he was seen by the disciples in Galilee. In the same way, after his resurrection in glory, we will see him, if now we pass over from sin to the heights of virtue.

So far, a brief explanation according to the words of the holy reading.

But because it might seem too little for a faithful soul to hear only this much on such a great feast day, you can find more comfort in the same holy reading. Notice how our gracious Savior arranged it so that his resurrection from the dead was made known to others through women. After he had first, as we rightly believe—though the Gospel does not explicitly say it—shown himself to his mother, he then appeared to these women, so that through them his resurrection might be announced to others. For since they had doubted less than the apostles, they were to know of his resurrection first, and then announce it to them.

So then, priests: when you go astray in following Christ, and women rebuke you, accept it gladly. For my part, I want to receive it gladly whenever some old woman teaches me something good—especially if she teaches me to live well. Others, however, count it foolishness that women should correct them, or teach them anything good. Just as even Christ’s own disciples considered what the holy women told them about Christ—by his command—to be nonsense, as St. Luke says in 24:11.

According to St. Gregory’s explanation, we search for Christ together with these women when, believing in him firmly, we are filled with the fragrance of virtues and, by the example of good works, we hurry to him who lay in the tomb for us. And just as those women saw angels, so faithful souls, filled with such virtues—sisters of Christ—receive angelic thoughts and especially revelations from God. The angel sat at the right side to show that Christ has already passed beyond a poor, mortal life and is now seated in eternal joy with the angels. The whiteness of his robe means the complete victory of Christ and the splendid and glorious reward he received as conqueror—and not only he, but we also. For his glorious resurrection is a comfort both to the angels and to us: to us, because if we die well, then after him we will rise from the dead and enter into eternal joy; and to the angels, because by our salvation their number will be filled up.

And that believers who seek Jesus do not need to be afraid of angels—nor of the visitation of death which angels bring—is shown by the angel’s words to the women who were looking for Jesus: “Do not be afraid.” St. Gregory says: It is as if the angel were clearly saying, “Let those be afraid who do not love the coming of the citizens of heaven; let those tremble who, weighed down by bodily desires, might suddenly be taken into their company. But why are you afraid, when you see your fellow-citizens?”

St. Matthew describes the angel who appeared to them in this way (28:3): “His face was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.” In lightning there is something fearful and terrifying; in snow there is whiteness and gentleness. Since almighty God is both terrifying to sinners and gracious to the righteous, it is fitting that the witness of his resurrection, the angel, appeared both with a face like lightning and in shining white, so that by his very appearance he might both frighten the wicked and comfort the faithful. And as he comforts the holy women, he says to them, “Do not be afraid! You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth.” For those who seek Jesus, the Savior, with holy intention do not need to fear his holy angels.

St. Matthew is especially clear about this in 28:5: “The angel said to the women, ‘Do not be afraid—you. For I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.’” As if to say: “Do not you, dear women, be afraid; let the evil bishops, priests, and scribes who crucified him be afraid, and those soldiers and armed men who are still guarding the empty tomb of Jesus.” Therefore, the women, rejoicing, ran from the tomb to the disciples; but the soldiers, terrified, fell down like dead men beside the tomb, as St. Matthew says in 28:4.

What then will happen to the wicked on Judgment Day, when Christ himself appears in glory? And how glad will those be who—living rightly—have sought Jesus, believing truly, confessing him joyfully, and following him faithfully? To them, in truth, we can say even today: “You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen from the dead”—that is, he is not dead in your hearts, but lives there by his grace.

What does it mean to say, “Christ has risen from the dead”? It means: He has come alive again. And what does “he has come alive again” mean? That having been dead in the body, he is now alive and will never die. What has he shown us by this? That we too will all die, and then live again. He died to sin in that he never sinned; we must also die to sin so that we may live in righteousness. He has come alive and will never die; we have been made alive in our souls by grace—let us never again die spiritually. Having risen from the dead, he says to the Father: “I have come alive again, yet I am still with you.” He, so powerful, was laid among the dead, yet was free among the dead; and he did not lie dead beyond the third day, so that his prophet might be found truthful—Hosea 6:2: “After two days you will revive us; on the third day you will raise us up.” What does the prophet teach here? Surely this: that the members must follow after the Head.

On Friday he redeemed humanity on the cross; on Saturday he rested in the tomb, having completed the work he had received; on the third day, which is the first full day of his resurrection, the conqueror of death showed himself as a new kind of man. So we also, if we follow our Head, Jesus, must in this “day”—that is, in this time while we live—without ceasing, carry our own cross and remain on it, as he remained on his, until the Spirit tells us to rest from our labors.

Let us not listen to anyone who tells us to come down from the cross. They shouted at him as he hung there, Matthew 27:42: “If he is the King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.” He did not come down. Instead, he showed something far greater and more powerful: that, after being truly dead, he came alive again and rose in might. That is a greater proof than if he had not died but had simply stepped down from the cross. Yet those who had shouted such words still did not believe. Therefore he did not listen to those liars, and he did not come down from the cross.

So we also, dearest brothers and sisters, must not listen to anyone who advises us to come down from our cross. Let us not listen in this to our own flesh, nor to fleshly blood relatives, nor to the devil, nor to any spirit. Let us stand firm on the cross; let us die on the cross; and let others take us down from the cross. Righteous men took Christ our Head down; and may holy merciful angels gently take us down. For when, in our “Friday,” things are thus finished for us, then on the first day after death we will rest with our bodies for a time, lie in our graves in blessedness, and sleep sweetly, waiting for the blessed hope—that is, our reward—and the appearing of the great God, who, as it were on the “third day,” will raise our bodies, now made like his glorious body.

So then, my dearest ones, there are, as it were, three “days” placed before us: the day of labor, the day of rest, and the day of resurrection. After these, may Christ grant us to dwell in his joy!
