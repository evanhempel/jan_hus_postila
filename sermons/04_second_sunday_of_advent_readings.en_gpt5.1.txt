### Reading For The Second Sunday In Advent

Saint Luke writes, chapter 21, verses 25–33.

At that time Jesus said: There will be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars, and on the earth distress of peoples because of the roaring of the sea and waves, as people will be drying up with fear and with expectation of what is coming upon the whole world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great power and glory. And when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near. And he told them a parable: Look at the fig tree and at all the trees; when they already put forth fruit from themselves, you know that summer is near; so also you, when you see that these things are happening, know that the kingdom of God is near. Truly I say to you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things take place; heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.

Last Sunday we remembered Christ’s coming in humility and meekness; today the reading shows Christ’s coming in power and majesty. For there it was said that the King came gentle and poor, riding on a donkey; but today the reading says that they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great power and glory: and this is so that those who do not want to love him as meek and humble may at least learn to fear him as mighty and glorious. Thus the remembrance of his first visitation serves to lift up our hope, and the remembrance of the second to preserve our holy fear, for Christians should have both hope and fear; fear restrains them so that they do not stumble into sin, and hope holds them so that adversities do not crush them. For Solomon says, Prov. 1, 32: The turning away of the simple will kill them, and the prosperity of fools will destroy them. Therefore in today’s reading both fear is laid down and hope is shown: fear and dread from the beginning of the reading up to the words, “And when these things begin”; and hope begins where it is then said, “lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.” And our Savior lays before us both fear and hope, and shows the signs that will happen before his visitation on the day of judgment, which will come when he says, “There will be signs in the sun and in the moon.”

Second, he sets forth his visitation, saying: “Then they will see the Son of Man.” Third, he sets forth the consolation of the righteous, saying: “Lift up your heads.” Fourth, he sets forth an admonition to keep watch against evil.

Thus this whole reading is given so that we would attentively look toward the final coming, or visitation, of Christ. For when the disciples asked Christ the Savior about the day of judgment, after Palm Sunday on the Mount of Olives, saying, Mt. 24, 3: Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your visitation and of the end of the world? then, among other words, he answered them, saying: There will be signs in the sun and in the moon and further. And the Savior sets signs in heavenly things, such as the sun, the moon, the stars; and also in earthly things, such as the earth and the sea, and in people, who will be drying up with fear and dread. And the Savior says: “There will be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars.” And what signs? He says in the reading of Saint Matthew, chapter 24, verse 29: The sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven. The sun has already had a sign, when it was darkened at Christ’s death, Mt. 27, 45, and likewise the moon at that time lost its light, and the stars, which take their light from the sun. But it can also be understood that the sun, Christ, will darken before the day of judgment, in such a way that people will not see with a living faith that sun; and the moon, which signifies the Christian assembly, will not give its light, that is, they will not shine with true teaching and with good works; and the stars, that is, people, will fall from heaven, that is, they will fall away from heavenly fellowship. For the dragon Antichrist, as Saint John testifies in the Revelation, Apok. 12, 4, will with his tail drag down from heaven a third part of the stars: not those stars which shine in the sky—for those will neither fall nor be dragged down by the dragon, for they remain there forever—but people will fall away from heavenly things through the terror and cunning of Antichrist and by the seduction of his messengers.

This Christ prophesied when he said beforehand to his disciples, Mt. 24, 4–5 and 24: See that no one leads you astray, for many will come in my name, saying: I am Christ! and will lead many astray. And later he says that false prophets will arise and will give great signs and wonders, so that, if it could be, even the elect would be led into error. And this is now being very much fulfilled, for Christ’s truth and Christ himself now shine little in people; they no longer even want the Gospel to be read and preached or Christ to be named; and whomever they catch openly confessing Christ’s truth, they curse him, persecute him, banish him, behead him and torture him and imprison him and kill him. For example, even now in Moravia an official and others have starved a faithful man to death, and they have let the feet of priest Martin, a preacher, rot away; and what happened last year in Prague, and is still happening now to those who hold to Christ’s truth, is known to many people. And all this comes from the messengers of Antichrist, false preachers, who, chasing after money from the people for their own greed, pride, luxury, and fornication, give forgiveness of sins for money, saying that the pope is an earthly god, who has power to give to whom he wills and when he wills the forgiveness of sins; but they do not tell the people that Christ says, Luc. 13, 3: Unless you repent of your sins, you will all perish! For they have darkened Christ and the truth so greatly that preachers now name the pope more than Christ, and praise and keep the pope’s decrees more than the law of our Lord Jesus Christ. And therefore his faithful children are given over to suffering in many lands; for both in Bohemia and in Moravia, in Meissen and in England, and elsewhere there is great persecution, as I myself know; they murder, torture, and curse faithful priests, and in Rome there is no end to it; indeed, there is the very summit of all Antichrist’s wickedness: pride, greed, fornication, hypocrisy, and simony, so that from Rome down to Bohemia simony and greed have poured out. For they sell and buy archbishoprics for more than many a lordship in Bohemia, and they farm out indulgences for rent, so that whichever of Antichrist’s messengers can pay more may squeeze more out of simple people. And therefore people are withering: some from fear to confess the truth against that error; others because, from the division of the clergy in preaching, they do not know what they should hold to; others have great sorrow that the rest go so astray; and still others suffer shame, being called heretics, and suffer murder, and likewise suffer because of the great persecution of God’s truth. For the sea is roaring, that is, the people of this world, who are likened to the sea. I say “roaring,” because they loudly proclaim that those who follow Christ and hold to his truth are the erring ones and heretics. And David says to this, Psalm 93, 4, that the liftings up of the sea are wonderful, that is, that people have risen up in a strange way against Christ and against the truth and have raised up their voice; for David again says, Psalm 93, 3: The floods have lifted up their voice.

So already there are signs in the sun, Christ, that now, because of the increase of sins, people do not see him with a living faith; and there are signs in the moon, that is, in those who should, taking the light of Scripture from Christ, shine for others—these now do not shine; and there are signs in the stars, that those who should cling with desire to heavenly things have inclined in desire to earthly customs, and especially those who ought to shine for others: such are masters and prelates, that is, those set above others in the spiritual office; for such learned men, who living badly make others worse, are falling away from the eternal light, whereas those who teach others righteousness, living well themselves, will shine forever. As Daniel the prophet says, chapter 12, verse 3: Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the sky, and those who lead many to righteousness like the stars forever and ever—that is, they will shine. See here, the prophet plainly calls good learned people, who teach others, stars; and they have their light from the sun, Christ, who is the sun of righteousness, as Malachias says, Mal. 4, 2: For you who fear my name there will arise the sun of righteousness. But to false priests and preachers that sun has set behind the hill, as the prophet Micheas says, chapter 3, verse 6: The sun will go down over the prophets, and the day will grow dark over them. And just before that he says, Micheas 3, 5: Thus says the Lord about the prophets who lead my people astray, who bite with their teeth and proclaim that there is peace, and if someone does not put something into their mouths, they declare a holy war against him. And perhaps this passage touches those who, against people who do not wish to be subject to them according to their will, proclaim a crusade and call the war holy and the battle holy, giving forgiveness of sins and of penalties to those who help in the fight. A strange thing: they cannot deliver themselves from fleas and flies, and yet they wish to deliver others from the pains of hell by their granting—for which they neither pray nor live otherwise well! And if there is some faithful Christian who preaches against their wickedness, then they bear hatred toward him, and by some invented pretext they suppress the divine service, since they cannot suppress the preaching that exposes their wickedness to the people in any other way.

By this cunning Antichrist in the highest degree drives forward his wickedness against the freedom and the praise of our Lord Jesus Christ. About this cunning I have written fully in other books, both in Bohemian and in Latin. And it seems to me that this cunning is the hardest and most grievous to faithful Christians; for neither shame, nor torture, nor death itself can stop the preaching of the truth in a faithful preacher of Christ who truly loves God; but the invented suppression of the divine service is a great hindrance, not only to the one who would like to preach, but also to the people who would like to hear. For what can more deeply trouble Christians than that they are denied burial, baptism, confession, and the body of the Lord? Among these hindrances the heaviest would be if they refused to baptize. But faithful and reasonable Christians would overcome this: priests would not obey such a command, and other people would not care where they were buried, and in great necessity they themselves would baptize their children, and so, with God’s help, they would tear apart Antichrist’s nets, with which he cunningly deceives people under the name of holy obedience. And this is that great tribulation of which the Savior says, Mt. 24, 21–22: For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will be. And if those days were not shortened, no one would be saved; but for the sake of God’s elect those days will be shortened.

Truly, the course of the present time gives the faithful understanding of that holy reading about the signs of the day of judgment, that by observing the course of events they might weigh the words of their Savior and, understanding them, carefully ready themselves against the cunning of Antichrist; for after those signs the coming of the Son of God will not be delayed. Of him the reading goes on to say that “the powers of the heavens will be shaken,” that is, the angels, as Saint Řehoř says, will be moved to come to judgment with the Son of Man against sinners. For Scripture says, Sap. 5, 18: He will arm his creation for vengeance on his enemies. Therefore it continues: “And then they will see the Son of Man,” that is, Jesus Christ, who is not the son of two human beings but of one human, the Virgin Mary, “coming”—that is, to judgment—“in a cloud”—what kind of cloud that will be, he himself knows!—“with great power,” that is, great power against proud sinners; for David the prophet says, Psalm 97, 3: Fire will go before him and will burn up all his enemies round about. “And with glory,” that is, for the consolation of the righteous; for immediately afterwards he gives comfort to his own, saying: “And when these things begin to happen, look up,” that is, look toward my help with a pure heart, “and lift up your heads,” that is, your minds; as Saint Řehoř says: To lift up your heads is to lift your mind to the joy of the heavenly Father. For the Savior then says: “because your redemption is drawing near,” as if he said: now your deliverance and the eternal condemnation of the wicked are at hand. The reading continues: “And he told them a parable: Look at the fig tree and at all the trees,” and so on; the Savior gives his own a similar sign, that just as when the fruit on the trees ripens, then summer is near, so when plagues, famines, wars, earthquakes, and the signs mentioned before are in the world, then for the faithful the kingdom of God is near, that is, the blessedness which they will have in heaven. Therefore the Savior goes on to say: “So also you, when you see that these things are happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.” And our Savior confirms this saying with an oath, saying: “Truly I say to you, this generation will certainly not pass away,” that is, mankind will not pass from death into immortality, “until all these things,” that is, those just spoken of, “take place.” He proves this, saying: “Heaven and earth will pass away,” that is, heaven will be changed and will be more beautiful after the day of judgment, and the earth will be changed, “but my words will not pass away,” that is, they will not change, but what I have meant by these words will always surely come to pass. So much briefly on the reading.

And because the merciful Savior often spoke of his final coming or visitation, warning his faithful and testifying how dreadful it will be, we must therefore diligently remember that coming, greatly weigh it, and so live well; for he will come to the wicked most terrible, so that the damned will say to the mountains, Ozeáš 10, 8 and Lukáš 23, 30: Fall on us! He will come, and he will not hear a single damned soul; he will come, and he will reveal all the wickedness of every person to all the angels, people, and devils; he will come, and with eternal fire he will burn all the damned; he will come, and he will sentence them to the eternal fire and to darkness and to every kind of evil misery. Therefore Saint Řehoř says today in his sermon: That day, dearest brothers, set before your eyes. And whatever seems hard to you now will then be light; for about that day the prophet says, Johel 2, 31: The day of the Lord is near, great and very terrible, and who can endure it? And the prophet Sofonias in chapter 2 says: The great day of the Lord is near, it is near and coming quickly, the sound of the day of the Lord is bitter, the mighty man will be there in distress, that day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and anguish, a day of sorrow and misery, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of cloud and storm, a day of trumpet and shouting. So says Sofonias, showing that the day of judgment will be very dreadful to the wicked. Of it Saint Peter writes in this way, 2. Petr. 3, 10–12: The day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a great rushing, and the elements will be destroyed with heat, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned. And since all these things are to be dissolved, what kind of people must we be in holy conduct and godliness, waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of our Lord Jesus Christ, on account of which the heavens, being on fire, will be dissolved, and the elements will melt with the heat of fire! So the blessed apostle writes about the day of judgment, on which day there will be over us above the Judge, offended by the wicked and angry with them, beneath us the dreadful hell opened, at our right all our sins openly accusing us, at our left the devils dragging us to hell, all around us and behind us the world burning, before us the angels driving into hell, within us a cruelly biting conscience, without us the eternal fire burning the body, and all the saints confirming the condemnation and saying together with the Judge: Depart, you cursed, into the eternal fire!

O most beloved, as we consider such a heavy and dreadful coming of Christ and the day of judgment, let us carefully remember Christ’s first coming, that, having taken flesh, he came into the world and labored for our salvation. Let us be grateful, that he may now visit us spiritually by his grace and may find us ready at death. Let us remember his last dreadful coming, so that we may be sentenced to heavenly joy; for Saint Řehoř says in today’s sermon: That day, dearest brothers, keep in mind with your whole full mind, correct your life, change your habits, overcome evil temptations, avenge the sins you have committed with tears; for you will behold the coming of the eternal Judge the more safely, the more you now, fearing his severity, prepare yourselves. May the merciful Savior, true God and true man, blessed forever, Jesus Christ, graciously bring all these things about for our salvation!
