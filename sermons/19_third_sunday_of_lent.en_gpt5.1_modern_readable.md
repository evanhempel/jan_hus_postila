# Third Sunday of Lent

Luke 11:14–28

At that time Jesus was casting out a demon, and this demon had made a man mute. When Jesus drove the demon out, the man who had been mute began to speak. The ordinary people, the simple folk in the crowd, were amazed. But some of them – the lawyers and the priests – said in fear: “He casts out demons by *Belzebub*, the prince of demons.” And others, putting Jesus to the test, kept asking him for a sign, a miracle from heaven. But he, seeing – as God – the thoughts of their hearts, said to them: “Every kingdom divided in itself – where there is no unity among the people – will be laid waste, and house will fall on house. And since Satan – who is my adversary – is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand, if I cast out demons by the devil? You say I cast out demons by *Belzebub*. And if I cast out demons by *Belzebub*, by whom do your sons – my apostles, who come from your own nation – cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. But if – *porro* – I cast out demons by the finger of God, that is, by the Holy Spirit, then – *profecto* – the kingdom of God has come among you – that is, I, who am the head of that kingdom, have come.

“When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own courtyard, all his possessions are at peace. But when someone stronger than he comes, overcomes him, takes away all his armor he trusted in, and divides up his spoils, then his power is broken. Whoever is not with me – in love – is against me – in sin, like the devil. And whoever does not gather with me – into the unity of love – scatters away from me in division.

“When an unclean spirit – a demon, made unclean through sin – goes out of a person – driven out by repentance – it goes through dry places, seeking rest – wanting some eternal resting place where it can dwell – and does not find it in a clean heart. Then it says: ‘I will return to my house, the sinner who is mine through sin, from which I came out.’ And when it comes and finds that house swept – cleaned with brooms – and decorated, it goes and *assumit* – takes – with it seven other spirits more evil than itself. They go in and live there, and the last state of that person – his later time – is worse than the first.”

And it came to pass that, while he was saying these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him: “Blessed is the womb that carried you, and the breasts that you nursed!” But he said: “Yes indeed, it is so as you say. But more than that: blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it – who do it.”

This holy reading contains many deep meanings, so first I want to explain it in line with the words.

This demon, this work of the devil, was called “mute” because he had made the man he tormented unable to speak. As Matthew says in chapter 12, verse 22, the man was both blind and mute. Christ cast out that demon, healed the man, and gave him back both his sight and his hearing.

There is no contradiction between Luke, who says “the demon was mute,” and Matthew, who says “he was mute and blind.” Because he was both mute and blind, Luke truly speaks when he says “the demon was mute” – that is, he made the man mute.

When Jesus cast out the demon, the mute man spoke and the blind man saw. The simple people in the crowd were amazed, and they began in some measure to cling to the truth that Christ is the Messiah, the Son of David. But others in the crowd, led astray, were afraid. And the lawyers, unable to deny the good work they clearly saw with their own eyes, insulted it by saying he did evil even while doing what was good. They said that Christ, like a sorcerer, had power through a pact with demons – the power of *Belzebub*, that demon who is prince over the other demons – and that by his power Christ cast out demons. They claimed he commanded them by *Belzebub’s* power, and the demons, as lesser beings, obeyed their prince and came out of people. In this way they said that Christ served and prayed to *Belzebub* so that *Belzebub* would work through his power.

Others, however, believed this power was from heaven, that he had truly cast out the demon, and they asked for a sign from heaven so he could prove to them that he did it by God’s power. And the Lord Jesus, seeing the root of the evil thoughts of the priests and lawyers, laid down five arguments against their false thinking.

From these grumblers, understand that in the time of Christ many people were tormented and overthrown by demons. The demons knew that Messiah Christ would be born from that people and would come into the world, and they feared lest this be the very Christ. So they stirred up the scholars, priests, and lawyers to twist Christ’s works, so that people would pay no attention to him and would reject his miracles as the tricks of an evil sorcerer. Therefore they said: “He casts out demons by *Belzebub*, the prince of demons!”

If what they said were true, then the devil’s power would be destroying itself. To show this, Christ gives a plain example: “Every kingdom divided in itself will be laid waste, and house will fall on house.” If a kingdom is to stand well, the people must be of one will, not undermining one another. If one party tears down the other, the kingdom will not stand well; both sides will be ruined, or one will be destroyed and so the kingdom will be stripped on that side. Christ says that, at the root, a divided kingdom will be ruined and will fall – as is well known of the kingdom of the demons, whose realm is ruined by Christ’s power and by the strengthening of his holy church.

“House falls on house” when a greater power crushes a lesser one out of proud envy – as among the demons, who are always against each other. And because, in that time, Christ was healing so many people oppressed by demons, and not by the power of *Belzebub*, they should have recognized the truth: since the devil’s kingdom is being broken this way, it means the Messiah has come – Christ – who has authority over demons to cast them out, and that he does not cast them out by Satan’s power, for Satan would be destroying his own kingdom.

Christ’s second argument, by which he rebukes the lawyers, is this: “If I cast out demons by *Belzebub*, by whom do your sons cast them out?” That is: if what you say is true, then I am a sinful man, an unfaithful sorcerer; but your sons – my disciples – who come from your own people, cast out demons in my name. Therefore, they will be your judges on the last day, declaring that by my power – which is above all demons – they cast them out, and that you falsely blasphemed me.

Christ’s third argument is: “Again, if I cast out demons by the finger of God,” that is, by the Holy Spirit, “then the kingdom of God has come among you” – that is, the Son of God, who is the head of the holy church, the kingdom of God.

The fourth argument: “When a strong man, fully armed, guards his courtyard, all that he has is in peace.” The devil is that strong man, fully armed; he had that mute man in his power. But a stronger man, Christ, came upon the devil, cut off his power, stripped off his armor, and took his courtyard. Therefore, Christ’s power is greater than the power of Satan and of *Belzebub*.

Understand that the devil is strong; for Job says in chapter 41, verse 24: There is no power on earth that can be compared to him. He also has armor – that is, natural cleverness – by which he knows how to deceive people. His courtyard, his house, is the poor human being in whom he dwells. One stronger than he is Christ, who stripped him of his armor – that is, of his crafty tricks – when he defeated him in the threefold temptation, as you heard from Matthew 4:1–11 on the first Sunday of Lent. And Christ divides his spoils among his own members when he restores to the holy church the power and virtues which the devil had stolen.

The fifth argument of Christ: “Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.” Here he proves that he does not cast out demons by the devil’s power, because he and the devil are opposed to each other: Christ is good, the devil is evil; Christ leads people into the unity of love, the devil divides them through sins. How then would the devil lend his power to Christ? In no way, for he would be destroying himself. By these arguments Christ shows that he casts out demons not by *Belzebub’s* power, but by his own.

Then Christ says: “When an unclean spirit goes out of a man.” By this “man” Christ means the human race. The devil first entered it in Adam and Eve, and from that time he has always been eager to harm. Seeing that he could not overcome the holy fathers in faith and in virtue, he went out from that people to the pagans, whose hearts were dry – without the moisture of God’s wisdom and grace. Seeking rest among them, he could not find it, for he can find no true rest anywhere. So, out of his habitual malice, he says within himself: “I will return to my house from which I came!” That is: I will return to the Jewish people, from whom I expect the Messiah will be born.

And when he came in the time of the Jews, he found that house empty of keeping God’s law and swept with brooms – that is, outwardly decorated with their religious regulations. They had set up many outward rules so that everything on the outside would look clean, but inside everything was unclean and empty of God’s grace.

Therefore Matthew 12:44–45 says: The demon finds the house empty, and then he goes and from his cunning takes seven spirits worse than himself – that is, the seven chief sins: pride, greed, sexual immorality, gluttony, envy, anger, and sloth. These spirits – that is, these sins of the evil spirit – are worse than any created spirit as such; for the devil, as a spirit, is God’s good creation, but he is evil because of these sins. So these evil spirits, entering into that “man” – the Jewish people – live in them more abundantly, more constantly, and more habitually than in other nations. For at that time the pagans had received fewer gifts from God than the Jews, and so they were less guilty. As a sign of this greater wickedness, more demons were with the Jews in that time than with the pagans. Many Jewish men and women had demons in them; and the priests, who in earlier generations among that people had been holier than others, in Christ’s time had become the very worst among the people.

Thus, in that “man,” in that people, the last state was worse than the first; for now they called the Son of God a servant of the devil and murdered him by a cruel death, and there the peak of their wickedness was completed.

So Christ meant by this saying that the evil spirit had, in earlier times, gone out from that line of the lawyers – that is, from the holy fathers – to the pagans, but now had returned to them; and that they themselves were that man whose house is swept outwardly before people by their religious rules, but inside is empty of all good; and that they were now worse than all who had come before them.

In the same way this can be understood about Christians. The devil had, to a great extent, departed from the first Christians, having less power over them, for they were good. But toward the end of the world he has returned again, for Christians now are very wicked. The more gifts people have received and refuse to use rightly, the more they show their wickedness. Therefore Saint Peter says in 2 Peter 2:21: It would have been better for them not to have known the way of truth. And because the priests of Christ’s law have received more gifts than the priests of the old law, they are worse because of their ingratitude.

Just as in the old covenant the first priests were great saints, and then goodness kept diminishing in their descendants, until the last became the worst and killed Christ, so in the new covenant the first priests – the apostles – were good; after them others were less good; and toward the end of the world the priests are the worst. And just as those priests drove Christ to death, so these will drive out his law and his faithful ones even to death, though they belong outwardly to the same faith as others, just as those priests outwardly shared the same law with the Lord Christ.

“And it happened that, while he was saying these things, a woman from the crowd raised her voice” – so that she might be better heard as she praised Christ against the blaspheming priests and lawyers – “and said to him: ‘Blessed is the womb that carried you, and the breasts you nursed!’” With these words she exalted both Christ and his mother, and shamed the mocking lawyers.

She acted boldly, forcing her words down the throats of many priests whose lie she exposed, for they had said: “He casts out demons by *Belzebub*, the prince of demons!” O woman, where did you find such boldness, that among so many enemies of Christ you were not afraid to speak like this, nor ashamed before your own prelates? And where did you gain such wisdom, that you greatly praised both the mother and the Son, and by the same words condemned the coming heretics together with those Jewish blasphemers?

Surely, the one who confirmed your words also gave you great faith, wisdom, and courage. He confirmed them when he said: “Yes indeed” – that is, it is just as you say. But not only is it true that I am blessed, and the womb that carried me, and the breasts that I nursed; “much more blessed are those who hear the word of God” with outward ears or inwardly in the heart “and keep it,” doing it in action. And so, by contrast, cursed are those who, hearing me and seeing my works, and seeing me cast out demons, still do not receive me, but refuse to believe my words and even blaspheme me.

Now, following this reading, notice that the Lord Jesus cast a demon out of a man, gave him back his hearing and his sight, and so did three marvelous works for that one person – and a fourth, that he knew the evil thoughts of the lawyers. By this he showed that he is true God, the very one whom the priests were blaspheming.

The same miracle Christ does today in a spiritual way when he casts a demon out of a person whom the demon has made mute – so that he will not confess his sins or praise God – and blind – so that he will not carefully look toward heavenly things. Christ casts the demon out when he gives that person his grace, so that he begins to speak the truth and praise God, and to see and know his Savior.

Such a person must remember that when Christ drives out of him the devil who was dwelling in him through mortal sin, if he then lets the devil back in, it will be much worse for him than before. For Christ says that “the unclean spirit takes with him seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they live there, and the last state of that man is worse than the first.” Worse, because his sin is far heavier than before, through his ingratitude for God’s kindness.

Therefore the merciful Savior, after healing one man, said to him in John 5:14: “Look, you have been made well. Do not sin any more, so that something worse does not happen to you.” For whoever returns to sin – to mortal sin – falls into these things:

First, ingratitude for God’s grace.  
Second, weakness and weariness in the spiritual life.  
Third, breaking of his promise.  
Fourth, distance from God – for such a person, returning to sin, drives God away from himself, so that God does not dwell in him by grace, and he gives place to the evil spirit with seven worse spirits, who then dwell in his soul.  
Fifth, he makes a mockery of God’s mercy.  
Sixth, he crucifies the Son of God a second time; for Saint Paul says to the Hebrews in 6:6 that those who return to – understand, to mortal – sins “crucify the Son of God again and hold him up to contempt.”

Therefore it is very necessary for every Christian to be watchful and careful to avoid falling into sin, as the saints did who came to repentance out of paganism or Judaism and afterward did not return to their former sins. Blessed is the one who keeps repentance as Christ has given it: being healed in soul, he does not go back again.

But woe to those who are like dogs and pigs, as Saint Gregory says: they vomit evil out and then take it back again; they wash themselves and then throw themselves back into the mud. Poor souls, others think that God deals with them as a barmaid in a tavern: a drunkard runs up a bill, pays it, and then goes on to run up another. In the same way they think that if they tell a priest their sins and mumble a few *Paternosters*, they are free of their debt and can go sin again in the same way.

They must know this: God does not forgive sin unless the person truly intends not to sin anymore – so firmly that, trusting in God, he would rather die than commit a mortal sin. And he must have such great sorrow that he regrets his sin more than he would regret losing all his wealth, or his friends, or anything else he has.

These two things set a person right and show whether he has true sorrow for sin, which is called contrition: first, a firm resolve never again to commit mortal sin; second, a deep sorrow that weighs the sin more heavily than any earthly loss.

May the merciful Jesus, who suffered a cruel death for us, by his grace bring us to this true contrition at last.
