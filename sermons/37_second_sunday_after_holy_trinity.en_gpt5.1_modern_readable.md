# Second Sunday After Holy Trinity

Gospel of St. Luke, chapter 14, verses 16–24.

Jesus our Lord and Savior spoke this parable: A certain man – that is, Christ – prepared a great supper. In other words, he specially prepared eternal joy. And he invited many – that is, all people – by his inner light. Then he sent his servant – that is, the company of preachers – at the hour of supper, that is, in the time when the Son of God became man, to say to those who had been invited that they should come, leaving their sins and clothing themselves in garments of virtue, because everything was already prepared without any lack, for Christ has been offered up, and so all things are ready for eternal joy.

But they all began, as one, to make excuses – that is, those who love earthly things more than heavenly joy. The first said: “I have bought a field” – that is, I have found pride – “and I must,” driven by my desire, “go out,” that is, leave the way of God, “and look at it. I beg you, have me excused” – that is, excuse me, pray to God for me, for I am a sinful man.

Another – the covetous man – said: “I have bought five pairs of oxen, and I am going out to test them; please, I beg you, have me excused.”

A third – the fornicator – said: “I have taken a wife” – that is, I have agreed to fornication – “and therefore I cannot come,” for I am driven by evil desire.

When the servant returned – that is, when he came back from his work to the supper – he told his master all these things: all their excuses and the hardness of those who had been invited. Then the householder – Christ – became angry because they did not want to come to such a supper, and he said, by inner teaching, to his servant: “Go out quickly,” that is, do not delay but go preach, “into the streets and lanes of the city,” that is, of this world, “and bring in here the poor” – those despised in this world – “and the crippled,” weak in understanding, “and the blind,” blinded by sin, “and the lame,” slothful and double-minded, wanting to be both good and evil at once. “Bring them into my house, to my supper.”

Then the servant said, “Master, what you commanded has been done – I have brought them in – and still there is room.” And the master said to the servant: “Go out into the roads and among the hedges – that is, wherever you can – and *compel* them, by terrors and power, to come in, so that my house may be filled,” that is, so that the number of the elect may be complete in heavenly joy. “For I tell you” – I, who cannot fail – “that none of those men who were invited” – hear this: and finally refused to accept – “will taste my supper,” that is, will share in heavenly joy.

In this holy reading our Savior shows his generosity and diligence, and human ingratitude.

His generosity: he prepared a great supper.

His diligence: he sent his servant three times to call the invited guests to the feast, that is, to that great supper.

Human ingratitude: they all alike made excuses and refused to come.

But the most dreadful word is at the end, when the One who cannot lie says: “I tell you, none of those men who were invited will taste my supper.”

At the beginning Jesus says: “A certain man…” Know that this “man” is Christ, who is a man above all other men. “Prepared” means: he prepared as God. “A great supper” means eternal joy for all the elect, who will sit at his table and feast forever.

This eternal joy is called a “supper” for several reasons.

First, just as after the supper of a day there is no more meal that day, so after that joy there will be no other joy. As St. Gregory says, there is nothing beyond it.

Second, at supper people usually eat the more delicate and pleasant food, so that they are not weighed down. In that joy there will be the most delightful satisfaction without any burden or weariness. For that reason too it is called a supper.

Third, at supper, it is the dearest friends who remain together, more than at midday. And in heavenly joy only those who are very dear to God will remain there, while the ungrateful will not taste of that supper, as the reading ends. So it is rightly called a supper.

And it is called a *great* supper for several reasons.

First, because of the greatness of the Master who prepared it. Who can be greater than Christ, true God and true man, King and Lord of the whole world – most mighty, most wise, most good, most beautiful, most generous, and therefore most comforting to those he invites? So the supper is truly great because such a great Lord prepares it.

Second, it is great because of the greatness of the guests who will be at that supper. There will be holy angels and also kings and queens. And there will be many, for the prophet Daniel says: “Thousands upon thousands serve him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stand before him.” Should this not be called a great supper when there are so many and such great guests?

Do not be shaken when Christ says in Matthew 22: “Many are invited, but not many are chosen.” He means that compared with all who are invited, those chosen for salvation are not many; there are many more invited than elected.

Third, the supper is great because of the great preparation. St. Paul says that no eye has seen, no ear has heard, it has not entered any human heart to grasp fully what the Lord God has prepared for those who love him. What greater thing can be imagined than the complete satisfaction of the will with no lack at all? That satisfaction stands ready for every one of the elect who with all desire is drawn toward that supper.

Fourth, the supper is great because it is eternal, without end. Oh, how great that supper is!

From this we can see the generosity and also the freedom of this “man” who has prepared a great supper, not in vain but so that it would be eaten and enjoyed. Therefore the text continues: “He invited many.” He invited many, in fact all: both those who will be chosen and those whom he foreknew would be lost. For he calls everyone by inner illumination, by which he has enlightened every person so that by nature we long for heavenly joy.

Beyond that he calls some by special gifts, some by sufferings, labors, and other trials. He calls by his written Word through the holy prophets.

And beyond even this, he sent his servant – that is, the company of preachers, apostles, and all their true successors. They are called one servant, for they all serve one supper, under the command of one Lord, and with one goal: to call those invited to the supper at the hour of the supper.

The “hour of the supper” is the time when the Son of God became man. In that time the sweetness of blessedness, heavenly joy, was made ready more clearly, and the supper is more eagerly desired.

And this is what the servants must say to those invited: that they should come, prepared – leaving their sins and clothing themselves with virtue – because all things are ready and nothing is lacking.

St. Gregory says: “All things are now ready,” because Christ has been sacrificed and the entrance to the kingdom is open.

Alas for the one who has a good road before him and everything ready, and yet refuses to go to that supper!

Why does such a person not consider that “a certain man,” Christ – mighty God and gentle, more gracious and generous than any other – has prepared a great supper, eternal joy, and is thereby showing his generosity?

That same “one man” gave himself to sinners as a ransom, to redeem them from sin, from the devil, and from eternal condemnation.

That “one man” gave himself as food for the sick to strengthen them, for prisoners to free them, and he will give himself as eternal comfort.

That man has prepared a great supper, eternal joy, which consists in knowing the Holy Trinity, in loving God, and in being fully satisfied in both. A person who knows God, and so knows the Holy Trinity and all things in it, will then love God with all his will, and will be so satisfied in that joy that nothing can move him away from it.

Now this man Christ, having prepared the supper, called many. But not many have come – that is, not many *will* come.

St. Gregory, *In om.*, says: “He called many, but not many come; for even those who submit to him by faith still oppose his eternal supper by living badly. They do not want to go there.”

So Christ goes on: “They all alike began to make excuses,” that is, those who love earthly things more than heavenly joy. They all began to make excuses.

The commentary says: Anyone who loves earthly things more than heavenly things is making excuses, even if he says with his mouth that he intends to go to heavenly joy. So Christ says they “all alike began to make excuses” – meaning, they refuse to do what would bring them there, even though, as long as they live here, hardly anyone dares to say with his lips, “I do not want to go to eternal joy.”

From among these excuse-makers, “the first said: ‘I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it; I beg you, have me excused.’”

This man represents every proud person who, having some property, is puffed up by it. St. Augustine says that in this purchased field we should see a picture of lordship and pride.

So when he says, “I have bought a field,” Augustine explains it: “I have found pride.” The first man, then, represents all the proud. They all delay going to the supper; each one by his evil deeds is refusing to go.

The first says, “I have bought a field,” that is, I have taken pleasure in pride, and for it I have given both my soul and the great supper. “And I must,” driven by my own desire, “go out” from the way of God “and look at it.” For pride depends very much on being seen, so that the proud person desires to be more visible and honored than others.

“I beg you,” he says to the servant of the Lord, “have me excused,” that is, excuse me. The explanation goes on: “Pray for me, for I am a sinful man.”

St. Gregory says: “Humility is on his lips, but because he refuses to come, pride is in his excuse.”

And every wicked person understands this. When he hears it, he knows very well what he is doing wrong, and yet, understanding it, he will not give it up. When we say to any wicked person, “Turn back, follow God, leave the world,” and so call him to the Lord’s supper, he answers: “Pray for me, I cannot do that.” What is he doing except making excuses and asking people to pray for him while he will not change? That is what Gregory points out.

“Another said: ‘I have bought five pairs of oxen, and I am going out to test them. Therefore I beg you, have me excused.’”

This second man represents all the greedy and covetous, who are weighed down under the yoke of greed, having harnessed to worldly wealth the five bodily senses. This yoke is the devil’s and the world’s binding. The devil and the world have tied these people and yoked them so that they pull in the direction of their desires.

So this man says, “I am going” – pricked by the devil’s sting – “to test them.” Fool! You have already bought them, and *now* you want to test them – just like the first fool who bought a field and then wanted to go see it!

And he too says, like the first, “Have me excused.” For these two sins – pride and greed – have many clever and hidden excuses. People cannot so easily recognize when they are sinning by pride or greed as easily as they can recognize fornication. For whenever anyone desires another person’s spouse for the act of sex outside marriage, he has already committed adultery in his heart and has sinned mortally. Therefore the third man, representing fornication, does not bother with excuses; he speaks plainly.

Christ says of him: “Another said: ‘I have taken a wife, and therefore I cannot come.’” He has “taken a wife” when he has agreed to fornication, and so he cannot come. He gives no excuse except this: he cannot come to the supper because he has taken a wife.

St. Gregory asks: “What is signified by ‘a wife’ here?” Only fleshly pleasure. For although marriage itself is good, ordained by God’s wisdom for offspring, yet many use it not for offspring but for satisfying bodily desire. Therefore this man does not picture holy married people, but every fornicator and every adulteress who love sexual sin more than the kingdom of heaven.

And I have truly heard both priests and laypeople groan and say that they cannot live without committing fornication, even if it meant they would be damned forever. Poor blind beasts, led by the devil! For a brief moment of lust they are willing to lose eternal joy and fall into everlasting damnation. Surely many men and many women will be damned for shameful fornication.

Then Christ continues: “The servant came back and reported all this to his master.” The servant “came back” – that is, after his labor he came to the supper – and “reported everything,” their excuses and the hardness of those who were invited.

Many who call others to this supper, when they see that the invited will not come, finish their work and return to prayer, and there they complain to God that people will not come to the supper. And not only do they speak to the Lord, but their very labors and the people’s excuses cry out to God that they refuse to come – not that God does not know it, but so that the wicked may know that both their sins and their excuses accuse them.

The text continues: “Then the master of the house became angry” – Christ became angry because they did not want to come to such a great supper – “and he said,” by inner teaching, “to his servant, ‘Go out quickly’” – do not delay, go and preach to the common people – “‘go out into the streets and lanes of the city’” – that is, of this world – “‘and bring in the poor,’” who may have some understanding but have no property, yet they will come to the supper before others, “‘and the crippled,’” those who by their nature are slow of mind, “‘and the blind,’” those blinded in spiritual things by the devil’s teaching, “‘and the lame,’” those who, because of laziness, do not walk in the way of God. “Bring them in,” that is, into my house, to my supper.

Look carefully at Christ’s words. They show that the rich who own fields, the strong who plow with oxen, and fornicators who are usually rich – satisfied with pride, greed, and sexual sin – do not care about eternal joy. So God commands that the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame be called, for they have fewer occasions to sin and will more quickly come to the supper.

But spiritually, the “poor” are those who have no grace and no virtue. Such people are also “crippled,” for without grace they can do no good for their salvation. They are also “blind” inwardly, for being blinded by wickedness they do not truly know God. And they are “lame,” having no true inward desire for God or for good works. For although by nature they desire the joy of the eternal supper, they still will not quickly leave their sins.

All these the servant – the preacher – must call and lead by good example and by God’s Word into Christ’s kingdom, to the supper.

Then the text says: “The servant said, ‘Lord, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room,’” room for more to enter.

“And the master said to the servant: ‘Go out into the roads and among the hedges.’” By these words the Savior shows that wherever his faithful servant can call people to the supper, he should do it. Christ clearly commanded this when he said in Matthew 16: “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.” And they went and preached everywhere – that is, wherever people would hear them.

But sadly, this road for preaching has been tied up by pride and greed and envy, so that God’s word does not have the freedom it first had. Antichrist is spreading his nets and narrowing Christ’s.

To Peter, Christ commanded that he spread his nets for fish, and he caught many. And because that catch of fish pictured the catching of souls with the net of God’s Word, Christ immediately told him that from then on he would catch people. And Peter truly did catch many, and the other holy apostles as well.

But the apostles of today’s Antichrist – if anyone wants to call people truly to the supper according to God’s command – at once they rise up against him, and will not allow him to call, unless he will preach according to their will, praise them, and never touch their sins.

Out of this Antichrist’s cannon-mouth the priests with the Archbishop of Prague, the priest Zbyněk, have fired a bull – a letter sealed with lead – which commanded that no one preach God’s Word anywhere except in parish churches, monasteries, and their graveyards.

But the Lord God put it in my heart to stand up against that bull and its decree, and not to obey it against this gospel. With God’s help I preached in spite of excommunication and the unjust stopping of the sacraments, and I still preach, and, if his holy grace allows, I will keep preaching, in hopes that I might be able to lead some poor, crippled, blind, or lame soul into Christ’s house to the supper.

Before, I preached in the cities and in their streets. Now I preach among the hedges, near a small castle called Kozi, between the roads that lead from towns and villages. For Christ says: “Go out into the roads and among the hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.”

He says, “Compel,” that is, by the terrors of eternal punishment. “Compel them to come in,” that is, let them come, “so that my house may be full,” that is, so that the number of the elect may be complete in heavenly joy.

“But I tell you” – I, who cannot fail – “that none of those men who were invited,” hear this: and in the end did not want to come, “will taste,” not only will they not enjoy the whole feast, but “they will not even taste my supper,” that is, heavenly joy.

Alas for the proud, the greedy, and the sexually immoral who excuse themselves like this! And even more alas for the one who is called a servant, whose task is to call others to the supper, and yet who, by his own pride, greed, and sexual sin, keeps *himself* away from the supper; who should be calling others, but will not call, and even hinders those who *do* call!

We have now seen Christ’s generosity in the great supper, his great diligence in the threefold sending of the servant, and human ingratitude in the refusal to come to such a great, generous, and gracious Lord’s great supper.

In this reading we also see three kinds of people invited to the supper.

First, those who, when invited, refused to come.

Second, those who came willingly: the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame, whom the servant brought in as the master commanded.

Third, those who came under compulsion, about whom the Lord said, “Compel them to come in.” If they could not come in under compulsion, the Master would not have commanded, “Compel them,” so that his house would be full.

So here a question arises: Since the Lord commands that they be compelled to come to the supper, should secular lords – kings, princes, nobles, knights, squires, and townsmen – compel people who are wandering and confused to come to that final supper?

At first it might seem they should not, for four reasons.

First, it might be said that a secular lord has no spiritual authority to compel anyone to that supper.

Second, that no one truly turns to God except freely, and so a forced coming to the supper would not profit those compelled.

Third, since going to this supper should be and is joyful and voluntary, and every forcing is unpleasant and against the will, how can the same action be both compelled and voluntary?

Fourth, that since each person has been given freedom to choose good or evil, how can that freedom stand together with being compelled against one’s will?

On this question, one thing is certain: it *is* right and fitting that secular rulers, by the order of love, compel confused people so that they go to that final supper. They have received from God power, lordship, and the sword for that very purpose, as St. Paul proves in Romans 13:1–4:

“Every soul” – that is, every person – “must be subject to the higher authorities. There is no authority except from God; and those that exist have been established by God. So whoever resists the authority [when it is used with proper order] resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will bring condemnation on themselves. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will receive praise from it, for it is God’s servant to you for your good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid, for it does not bear the sword for nothing; it is God’s servant, an avenger to bring wrath on the one who does evil.”

So says Paul, clearly teaching that every person must be subject to the higher power of the secular ruler, and that the ruler therefore bears the sword in order, for God’s praise, to punish evil with power and to drive people to keep God’s law, and so to the final supper, and to defend the good.

St. Peter says the same in his second chapter: “Submit yourselves to every human authority: whether to the king as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish evildoers and to praise those who do good.”

From Christ’s word “Compel them to come in,” from these writings of two of his apostles, and from much other Scripture, we see that the king, the prince, the lord, is God’s servant, holding lordship, power, and the sword to defend the good and to compel the evil – whether they are laypeople or clergy. Both alike are to be subject to higher authority.

But Antichrist, from this same Scripture, wants to exempt his priests by his own decrees, so that now, no matter how wicked a priest’s life is, they claim that the secular lord must not deal with him, must not punish him, must not even lay a hand on him.

But the humble Jesus said to the Jewish crowds in John 8:46: “Which of you can convict me of sin?” Antichrist, however, says the opposite: “None of you may convict me of sin!”

Humble Paul and Peter and the other saints walk after Christ; the proud follow Antichrist.

Now, to answer the first objection, that a secular lord has no spiritual power to compel toward the supper: I answer, he *does*. That is exactly why the lord has income and lordship: to restrain the wicked with power and to protect the good. We have an example in the Old Testament, in 3 Kings (1 Kings) chapter 2, verses 26 and 35, where King Solomon removed Abiathar, the high priest, from the priesthood and sent him to his land, and put Zadok the priest in his place.

To the second objection – that no one turns to God except freely – know this: sometimes something begins against a person’s will and ends with his will. A young woman, for example, is sometimes unwilling to marry the man her father chooses. She wants someone else. But when her father compels her, it often happens that later she lives with that man gladly and willingly. Her going to him at first, unwilling and compelled, later becomes profitable to her, for children and for many other things.

Likewise here: at first a person is unhappy that someone compels him to leave gambling, or adultery, or some other sin, but later he will be grateful that he was turned away, and so it is profitable to him for the eternal supper.

From this you already have the answer to the third objection: that going to the supper by compulsion is not pleasant at the beginning. True – but when a person comes to understand, it will become pleasant and voluntary.

The same example of the young woman serves here. Another example: A merchant is in a ship at sea with a heavy cargo. The ship is overloaded and sinking. Seeing this, he throws the cargo overboard, preferring to lose his goods rather than drown with them. Throwing the cargo into the sea is in one sense unpleasant, but for the sake of preserving his life it becomes a free and willing act. The beginning is unpleasant; the end is glad.

So the same action may be called both forced and voluntary, but in different ways: forced at the beginning, voluntary at the end. Throwing out the cargo is, in one respect, forced, for the merchant would not like to lose his goods; yet it is also voluntary, for he would rather throw them away than drown with them. In the same way, being compelled toward the eternal supper is at the start forced and unpleasant, but at the end joyful. Medicine is unpleasant to the sick person when the doctor sews a wound or cuts a limb; but when the patient is healed, he is very thankful for the painful treatment.

To the fourth objection, I say: the will is always free. No one but God can so compel it that a person wills something when he himself does not will it. Freedom of the will remains even when someone else’s pressure moves it so that he *more readily* chooses than he would without that compulsion.

So now you see: it is fitting for secular lords to use their power to drive the wicked toward goodness. And it is fitting for priests, not mainly with power but with good admonition, to lead people to the supper.

To both, Christ has given instruction in this very reading. To the priest he says, “Call.” To the lord he says, “Compel.” He has also given them his own example: he teaches priests gently; and he shows rulers his royal firmness when he drove the moneychangers out of the temple with a whip, when with a word he threw down the Jewish crowd who came to arrest him, and when he cast Saul – that is, St. Paul – to the ground on his journey as he was going to seize Christ’s servants.
