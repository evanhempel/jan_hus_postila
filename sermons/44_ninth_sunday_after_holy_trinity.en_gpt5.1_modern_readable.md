# Ninth Sunday After Holy Trinity

Luke 16:1–9

“At that time the Lord Jesus spoke this parable: There was a certain rich man who had a steward; and that steward was accused before him of wasting his goods. So he called him and said to him: ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you will no longer be able to be steward.’ 

Then the steward said to himself: ‘What shall I do, since my lord is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg. I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from the stewardship, people will receive me into their houses.’ 

And so he called every one of his lord’s debtors and said to the first: ‘How much do you owe my lord?’ He said: ‘A hundred measures of oil.’ And he said to him: ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and write fifty.’ Then he said to another: ‘And you, how much do you owe?’ He said: ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ He said to him: ‘Take your bill and write eighty.’ 

And the lord praised the steward for acting wisely. For the children of this world are more shrewd in their generation than the children of light. And I say to you: Make for yourselves friends with the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when you are in need, they may receive you into the everlasting dwellings.”

The gracious Savior, wanting especially to teach His disciples *prudence* and *mercy*, spoke this reading to them, as Luke says: “He said to His disciples: ‘There was a rich man…’” and so on.

The office of stewardship and the giving of account applies especially to *prelates*—to those raised up over others, rulers in church and world—who must give an account both for themselves and for those they rule, before God.

In this parable I see three terrible things that threaten anyone who wastes the Lord’s goods.

1. First: he is *accused*.
2. Second—and worse: he must *give an account*.
3. Third—and worst of all: he *will no longer be allowed to rule*.

Who would not fear being accused before an earthly king, knowing he is guilty? How much more should he fear when he knows for certain that he must give a full account before that king? And more than that—when he knows he will be stripped of his office altogether, unable to work, too ashamed to beg after his high position?

So must every official of the great Lord Christ tremble, if he is wasting the Lord’s goods. For Christ is that “rich man” of whom this reading speaks. He is “one”—that is, *the* one unique Lord—rich above all, because He alone is true God and true man. As John writes in the Apocalypse (19:16), He has written on His garment and on His thigh: “King of kings and Lord of lords.”

“He had a steward”—that is, *every person* is His steward, and especially every prelate and every worldly ruler.

He has made each person steward of:

- His own soul, that he keep it pure.
- His body and its senses, that he guard them from sin.
- His neighbor, to love him as himself.
- And Christ Himself, who has given Himself to us, that we honor, love, and obey Him above all.

Besides these, God has given each of us more: health, skills, and earthly possessions; and through baptism and afterwards He has given virtues—faith, hope, love, and many other graces. To many He has entrusted authority over other people.

That God has given to each person a soul and a body, no one can deny. Scripture says He is the Creator of all things, and that whatever a person has, he has from Him. And He has given man *freedom*, whether he will keep his soul or not.

Scripture says in *Ecclesiasticus* (Sirach) 15:14–18: God from the beginning created man and placed him in the hand of his own counsel. He added His commandments, that man should keep them. If you will keep the commandments, they will keep you; and you will do what is pleasing to Him forever. He has set before you water and fire: stretch out your hand to whichever you choose. Before man are life and death, good and evil; what he chooses shall be given to him.

Here you see how God has placed each person’s soul into his own hand—that is, under the power of his reason—so that by reason, holding to God’s commandments, he may govern it. If he keeps those commandments until death, they will keep him forever.

God has set before man’s reason water and fire, life and death, good and evil, that he might stretch out his hand—his desire—to whichever he wants. If he chooses to put his hand into the fire, he himself is guilty.

Likewise, good stands before him—God’s commandments, with eternal life behind them. Evil stands before him—sin, with eternal death behind it. He is free. Wherever he reaches with his will, that will be his.

Therefore every person should be diligent to keep his soul pure for his Lord, and also keep his body from sin by holding to His commandment. In this way he honors, loves, and praises the Lord God above all other lords. If he does not do this, then he already stands *accused* before God.

First, he is accused by his own *sin*. Sin itself cries out against a person and makes him ugly before God. No one can truly accuse a person before God, or shame him in the eyes of heaven, if he has no mortal sin—and finally not even habitual, everyday sin—on his soul.

Just as a stench marks and reveals a foul thing, so sin marks and exposes the sinner. We see this in the citizens of Sodom. Their sin cried out before God, as it is written in Genesis 18:20.

Scripture says that three sins especially accuse sinners:

- Bloodshed,
- Murder,
- And withholding wages.

Second, a person is accused before God by his *conscience*. Third, by the *angels*. Fourth, by the *demons*. And on the Day of Judgment every *creature* will testify against him.

The greater the goods of his Lord he has destroyed, the greater the accusation will be.

So the reading says: “There was a certain man”—that is Christ—“a rich man,” the Lord of all the world, rich indeed—“who had a steward,” that is, to whom He had given authority over others.

“And that man was accused before him of wasting his goods.” Understand that people waste the Lord’s goods in two ways.

First, by hoarding them badly. For this James warns in chapter 5:1–3: “Come, now, you rich, weep and howl over the miseries that are coming upon you. Your wealth has rotted, your garments are moth-eaten, your gold and silver are corroded, and their rust will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up treasure in the last days.” Woe to those rich people to whom this Scripture points, unless they repent.

Second, people waste goods by *spending them badly*—on pride and bodily pleasures. So wasted his goods that rich man who dressed in purple and fine linen and feasted splendidly every day. And when he died, he was buried in hell, as Christ says in Luke 16:19, 22–23. I wrote of him earlier in sermon 33.

From this you see: misers and spendthrifts both waste the Lord’s goods. In between them stands the generous person, who gives where he ought to give.

- Misers are those who refuse to give, though they have enough, where they ought to give freely.
- Spendthrifts are those who give where they should not: to entertainers, to women for lust, on drunkenness and gluttony, on proud clothing, cutting and refashioning garments in vanity, and in many other foolish ways.

Who can fully describe how people waste?

Even if I cannot list every kind of waste, yet every such squanderer is accused before God of wasting His goods.

The reading goes on: “So he called him.”

That calling, after which a man will no longer be able to rule or dig and will be ashamed to beg, is the call of *death*. Yet God also calls a person in this life:

- inwardly, by the stirring of the heart;
- some, outwardly, by the preaching of His word;
- some, by sickness;
- some, by great gifts;
- some, by great opposition from people;
- and some, as the commentary says, God calls by placing in their soul a fear of eternal damnation.

So He dealt with that rich man of whom Christ speaks in Luke 12:19–20: “Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; rest, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself.” But God said to him: “Fool! This very night your soul is demanded from you, and the things you have prepared—whose will they be?”

And our final calling will be when, on the last day, God will say: “Rise, you dead, and come to judgment!”

Then the reading says: “He said to him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship!’”

Here rulers and prelates may learn:

- First, that they should *summon* the accused before they punish him for the accusations of others.
- Second, that they should punish clear, known sins, and not pretend not to see them. Notice: the lord “called him,” and when he was called, “he questioned him.”
- Third, that they should question *him himself*. “He said to him…”
- Fourth, that they should question him about the matter of which he is accused, so that by learning the truth they might rightly punish if he is guilty, or acquit him if he is innocent. So he says, “What is this I hear about you?”
- Fifth, that they should hear him calmly: “Give an account of your stewardship.”
- Sixth, that if he is unworthy, they should remove him from office. So he says: “You will no longer be able to be steward.”

Here I notice a frightening word that my Lord says to me: “Give an account of your stewardship!”

It is frightening because it is the *Lord* who says it:

- the Lord before whom nothing can remain hidden;
- the Lord before whom nothing can be denied;
- the Lord from whom no one can escape;
- the Lord who will require an account of the least word and thought.

He says in Matthew 12:36: “From every idle word that people speak, they will give account on the Day of Judgment.”

Such a mighty, wise, and just Lord says to me: “Give an account of your stewardship.” I hear a terrible voice directed at me, for the Lord will question me how I *entered* the priesthood:

- Did I enter in order to seek His glory above all, and to help my neighbors and myself toward salvation?
- Or did I enter in order to have plenty of goods, to be exalted above others, and to live a life of pleasure?

He will also ask why and *how* I remained in the priesthood. And third, how I *finished* in it.

“How did you come in?” He says, as in Matthew 22:12: “Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?” Friend, who brought you in? Was it truth or was it lies? Was it Christ or the devil? Was it love or pride? Was it hard work or desire for pleasure? Was it money or the grace of the Holy Spirit?

“Give an account of this! Give an account of your deeds! Give an account of the people you were supposed to lead to salvation and did not!”

Woe to us priests if we do not lead the people toward salvation, for we must give an account for them. God says in Ezekiel 3:17–18: “Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. You shall hear the word from My mouth and warn them from Me. When I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ and you do not warn him or speak to turn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.”

Woe to the priest who lets someone perish by not faithfully speaking God’s word to him. Woe to the one who *forbids* preaching. Woe to the one who does not keep watch over the people. Woe to the one who, by evil example or pressure, leads others into sin.

Paul says in Romans 14:12: “Each of us will give an account of himself to God.” But for us priests he adds more, writing to the Hebrews (12): we must give an account for *souls*—for those under our care.

All this will happen when the great Lord says to each of us: “Give an account of your stewardship, for you will no longer be able to be steward.” Stewardship will end when a person has nothing left in his own power.

The reading continues: “The steward said to himself: ‘What shall I do, since my lord is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg. I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from the stewardship, people will receive me into their houses.’”

This steward acted wisely.

First, he *came to himself*. He had not been “at home” in his right mind when he was wasting his master’s goods. So Christ says, “He said *in himself*”—that is, he thought, before death, about what would meet him *after* death.

He recognizes first that after death, when stewardship ends, there is no more time to earn merit. This is what he means when he says, “I cannot dig.”

Second, he admits that it is shameful for the dead to beg help from the living, unless they had earned such help *while they were alive*. Only then is it without shame. This is what he means by, “I am ashamed to beg.” For neither the damned nor the souls in purgatory can, without shame, beg help they have not deserved; as that rich man buried in hell was not heard, when he begged that even a single drop of water might be given him.

Third, this steward turns to a *good remedy*. While he is alive, he does good to his fellow servants, so that when he dies, they, still living, might help him. That is what he means: “I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.”

These three things we must note:

- recognize how short our stewardship is,
- understand our misery,
- and say with holy Job (Job 31:14): “What shall I do when God rises up? When He calls me to account, what shall I answer Him?”

The reading goes on: “So, calling every one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first: ‘How much do you owe my lord?’ He said: ‘A hundred measures of oil.’”

Notice: he *called* the debtors and reduced their debts without their asking, so that they would receive it more gladly.

These debtors are the poor, who owe God “a hundred measures of oil”—that is, a devout and loving will.

Then the steward says: “Take your bill, sit down quickly, and write fifty.” The commentary says he forgave him half his debt.

This teaches that Christians should be *more generous* in almsgiving than the Jews were, as we see in Zacchaeus, who said in Luke 19:8: “Lord, look, I give half of my goods to the poor.”

The reading continues: “Then he said to another: ‘And how much do you owe?’ He said: ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ He said to him: ‘Take your bill and write eighty.’”

To the first, he forgave half; to this one, a fifth. This teaches that Christians should sometimes forgive *more* to one poor person, and less to another; give more to one, less to another. And because he forgave more oil than wheat, though oil is more precious, we learn that:

- The one who has much should give much.
- The one who has more should give more.

Also:

- We should *desire* to give more than we actually give.
- We should give more to the sick than to the healthy.
- We should give more to those who are more useful and fruitful, than to those who are less useful.

So our dear Savior gave this parable so that we, as stewards of God’s goods, would have compassion on the poor and help them freely from mercy—and especially we priests, who are stewards of the alms given for the poor.

The reading says further: “And the lord praised the steward of the goods.” In Latin it says: *villicum iniquitatis*—“steward of iniquity” or “of unrighteousness.”

This can be understood in two ways.

First: “He praised the *steward of iniquity*”—that is, the *wicked* steward, who had been a bad steward because he wasted his lord’s goods and dealt faithlessly with his lord by remitting debts without his knowledge. He is “steward of iniquity” because he is a wicked man.

Second: He praised the steward of *iniquitatis*—that is, the steward of *unrighteous goods*, of wealth that leads many people into iniquity. This sense fits Christ’s later words: “Make for yourselves friends from the mammon of *iniquity*”—from wealth that draws people into sin. Not that wealth itself is guilty, but that people, desiring it wrongly, fall into sin.

So, in our reading, I have simply said “steward of goods” and not “steward of iniquity.”

“He praised the steward of the goods, because he had acted wisely.” He did not praise him for being unfaithful to his lord, but for being *shrewd*: he remembered that he had ruled badly, he understood his lord’s justice, and he prepared for his future poverty.

In the same way, we must be prudent:

- grieving over what we have wasted,
- looking at God’s justice,
- facing the misery that may meet us.

If we do this, Christ our Lord will also praise us for our prudence.

He continues: “For the children of this world are more prudent in their generation than the children of light.”

That is: the lovers of this world are more careful in their business than the children of God in *theirs*. The worldly run after their affairs with great desire, diligence, and effort. The spiritual do not pursue their spiritual business with equal zeal.

Why?

First, because the lovers of this world receive the reward of their business *immediately*, visibly; but the children of light must *wait* for their reward.

Second, because the body weighs down the soul toward earthly things, as Scripture says in 2 Corinthians 4:16: the outward man that is decaying burdens the soul.

Know that evil people are called “children of this world”:

- First, because they shape their way of life after this world, against Paul’s word in Romans 12:2: “Do not be conformed to this world.”
- Second, because they are full of the goods of this world, against Paul’s word in 1 Timothy 2: “No one serving as a soldier for God entangles himself in worldly affairs.”
- Third, because they are great lovers of this world and enemies of God, as James says in chapter 4:4: “Whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.”
- Fourth, because they love the inheritance of this world more than the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven.

Good people are called “children of light”:

- First, because they do works of light—that is, virtues, which are works of the light of truth. As Paul says in Romans 13:12–13: “Let us put on the armor of light, and walk properly as in the day.”
- Second, because they love the Light—that is, Christ, who says in John 8:12: “I am the Light.”
- Third, because they are heirs of eternal light.

Then Christ says: “And I say to you, make for yourselves friends with the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when you are in need they may receive you into everlasting dwellings.”

With these words Christ shows what He meant by the parable: that we should give our goods to the poor, and so win them as our friends, that after death they may receive us into the heavenly dwelling.

So He says: “And I”—that is, I, that Lord who has stewards—“say to you, My servants and stewards: Make for yourselves friends”—that is, angels, holy people, and the poor—“from your earthly goods, which are called ‘mammon of iniquity’ because they are the occasion of sin for many.”

Know this: Christ does *not* command anyone to gain goods *unjustly* and then give to the poor. He commands that we give from goods *rightly gained*.

Scripture says in *Jesus Sirach* (Ecclesiasticus) 34:24: “He who offers a sacrifice from the goods of the poor”—that is, from what he has taken from them—“is like one who kills a son before his father.” He is like a murderer who then presents the murdered son to his father.

Robbers, usurers, and other unjust gainers of wealth greatly deceive themselves when they think they please God by taking much unjustly, giving a little to the poor, and building many altars and hiring many priests.

Augustine says: giving to God from such wealth is as if they wanted God Himself to be a partner in their sins—as if He were the receiver of their usury and robbery.

Priests receive such gifts. Monks enjoy them. Both praise the givers for their generosity, but they do not tell them that they are sinning heavily. And if they want to repent, they must *restore* what they have wrongly taken to those poor people they have deceived or robbed.

Zacchaeus said before Christ in Luke 19:8: “Lord, look, half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have cheated anyone of anything, I restore fourfold”—that is, three times more than he took.

Whoever does as Zacchaeus did makes himself a friend—Christ the Lord, all the saints, and those to whom he restores what was stolen. They will pray to God for him.

Someone may say: “There is a woman who has gained money or goods by love affairs or adultery. Since she cannot rightly use those goods, what should she do with them? God has forbidden her to offer such money as an offering.”

I answer: if that woman truly grieves over her sins, she may give that money or those goods to the poor. It is not right to return them to the wicked men who gave them for sin; and she herself may not freely keep them, unless she is so poor that she has nothing else—if, for example, she has only one undergarment and one dress that she received in sin.

In such great need, so that she is not left naked, if she has no friend who will clothe her, she may keep and wear that garment until she earns another. And she may say: “Dear Lord God, You are Lord of this garment. Please allow me, a sinner, to wear it, as having received it now from You, my merciful Lord. For since You receive sinners and give them grace that clothes better than any bodily garment, grant me also, a sinner, this undergarment or dress.”

In the same way, any other sinner who has wrongly gained goods or clothing may, in last, extreme need, do so. For in such necessity all things are to be held in common, as God Himself is common to both good and evil people, giving them bodily needs, sun, and rain.

Now you see how we are to make friends from our goods, as the Savior commands. And not for nothing. He adds: “that when you are in need…”

That means:

- when your *own works* will not be enough for you,
- or—what I think is clearer, since in Latin it says *cum defeceritis*—“when you die.”

“Then they will receive you,” that is, the saints will welcome you, “into everlasting dwellings”—in Latin *tabernacula*, eternal tents, in which the saints will dwell forever.

And so it is: merciful people—those who do works of mercy for the poor and live rightly—are, immediately after death, received into the kingdom of heaven.

May the merciful Savior help us to be among them, He who will say on Judgment Day to the merciful: “Come, you blessed, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” Amen.
