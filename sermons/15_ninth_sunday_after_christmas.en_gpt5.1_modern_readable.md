# Ninth Sunday After Christmas

Saint Luke writes in chapter 8, verses 4–15:

At that time, when a great crowd was gathering and people were hurrying to Jesus from the cities, he spoke in a parable: “A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled down, and the birds of the air came and ate it up. Other seed fell on rock, and when it sprouted it withered, because it had no moisture. Other seed fell among thorns, and when it grew up together with the thorns, the thorns choked it. And other seed fell into good soil, and when it went down and grew up it produced a crop a hundredfold.” After he said these things, he cried out, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear!”

His disciples asked him what this parable might mean. He said to them, “To you it has been given to know the mystery (*mysterium*) of the kingdom of God, but to the others it is in parables (*per similitudinem*), so that seeing with their physical eyes they do not truly see with their spirit, and hearing they do not understand in a way that brings salvation to themselves. Now this is the parable (*Est autem haec parabola*—that is, it is explained like this): The seed is the word of God. Those along the path are the ones who hear, then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts so that they will not believe and be saved. Those on the rock are the ones who, when they hear, receive the word with joy, but they have no roots; they believe for a time, but in the time of testing they fall away. The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by worries, by riches, and by pleasures of life according to the evil habits of the flesh, and they are suffocated in their spiritual life, for the word of God dies in them. But the seed on good soil stands for those with a good and best heart; they hear the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit in endurance—that is, they suffer steadfastly to the end for the sake of the word of God.”

Luke shows three things: first, that a great crowd was hurrying to Jesus; second, that Jesus spoke to them in a parable; and third, that he himself explained that parable to his disciples.

About the first point it was said earlier that people hurried to Jesus with many different motives: some for healing, some for food, some to see miracles, some for good teaching, and the priests came to find fault and to mock and blaspheme. So the reading says: “When a great crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from the towns,” understand this: some came to hear him for the salvation of their souls. And because there were few of that kind, he did not preach in such a way that everyone would understand at once. As he himself says in the reading, he speaks in parables so that hearing, they do not understand.

The reading says: “He told this parable.” In this he taught his disciples not to hand over God’s secrets at once to the ungrateful whenever *they* want, for he said in Matthew 7:6: “Do not give what is holy to dogs”—that is: do not give the words that make people holy to those who slander and tear them apart.

I do not need to give you other reasons why he spoke in parables, because he himself answered that he spoke this way so that the evil would not understand. There *are* other reasons—such as this: that by examples he might teach simple people and fix the truth in their memory, and that through earthly things he might lift us up to heavenly things. So our gracious Savior sometimes spoke openly and sometimes hiddenly in parables; and afterward he explained them to us, as today’s reading shows.

Therefore Saint Gregory says that this reading does not need more explanation, only exhortation—for since the Truth himself has explained it, a fragile, meddling human being should not dare to go beyond that. So says Gregory.

Holding then lovingly to our Savior’s own explanation, I remind myself and you of this: if the seed—which is the word of God—falls into people given over to sexual sin, those who are like the path, whose hearts are pressed down by lustful thoughts, that word withers and does not bring blessedness. If it falls on the rock—that is, on a hard heart full of pride and despair—it again brings no fruit. If it falls among thorns—that is, into a greedy heart—it dies, as Christ says, choked by worries, by wealth, and by pleasures.

So Christ shows that in the sexually immoral, the proud, and the greedy, the word of God does not prosper. And because the whole world is filled with such people, there are only a few in whom the word of God bears fruit.

That the world is filled with them, Saint John testifies in 1 John 2:16: “Everything that is in the world is either the lust of the flesh, or the lust of the eyes, or the pride of life.” The lust of the flesh is sexual sin and fleshly pleasure. The lust of the eyes is greed, because the greedy person wants to have whatever he sees. The pride of life speaks for itself.

Look—by these sins the people of this world, that is, the evil in the world, are filled. Every wicked person is either sexually immoral, or greedy, or proud—and some are full of all three. And no one can remain in deadly sin after baptism without being proud, for Scripture says in Ecclesiasticus 10:13: “The beginning of every sin is pride.” The devil first fell into pride, wanting to be like the Most High in power, or equal to him, and not wanting to be subject to him. For whoever wants to have no one over him, that one wants to be the highest of all. That is how the angel Lucifer thought; and he has now become “Luciper,” that is, being once shining, he is now in darkness.

By this very same sin everyone sins who does not keep even one of God’s commandments.

Here is an example: God says, “You shall not commit adultery,” and you then go and commit sexual sin—perhaps on a feast day. Right there you first show pride against God, because you do not obey him. Second, you show greed, because you reach out for more than you should have; for greed is not only about money, but also about cows, or horses, and the same about women. Third, you have committed sexual sin. Fourth, you have committed envy: you have envied that woman, widow, virgin, or even a married woman, because before you touched her she belonged to another and was not despised by you. Fifth, you have stirred up anger against your own soul, for Saint David says in Psalm 11:5: “Whoever loves evil hates his own soul.” Sixth, you have committed sloth, for at that time you should have been serving God, and you wasted it. Seventh, you have indulged bodily pleasure that goes even beyond greed.

So, in my view, when you commit one deadly sin, you actually commit seven—and indeed you have broken *all* God’s commandments.

The first commandment is: “You shall have no other gods.” And you have loved a woman as your god. For the saints say: whatever a person loves more than God, that is the god he has. Believe Saint Paul the apostle, who writes in Philippians 3:19 that the god of some people “is their belly”—that is, of the gluttons. And elsewhere he says in Colossians 3:5 that greed is idolatry.

The second commandment is: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.” You swore at your baptism in Christ, you renounced sexual sin, pride, and every deadly sin; and then you commit sexual sin. You have taken the Christian name from Christ, and then you have taken his name in vain. For Saint Augustine and Saint Cyprian, the great martyr and bishop, say that whoever does not follow Christ in his deeds takes the Christian name in vain. And how does a fornicator follow the pure virgin Jesus Christ?

The third commandment: “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” To keep it holy is to avoid sin carefully; and then you go and commit sexual sin on a feast day, or you flirt, dance, and plan for sexual sin.

The fourth commandment: “Honor your father and your mother.” And you, by your sexual sin, do not honor your Father—God—nor your most worthy Mother, holy Church, which is the assembly of all those chosen for salvation together with the Lord Christ.

The fifth commandment: “You shall not murder.” And by your sexual sin you have killed your own soul and that of the one with whom you sinned.

The sixth is: “You shall not commit adultery.” This you have broken directly.

The seventh: “You shall not steal.” You steal from God his praise and from yourself your time by your sexual sin. You hide like a thief so that others will not see you, and you do not remember that God is everywhere, that he sees you everywhere, and the angels and the saints in heaven see you too. And when you know that stealing is taking another’s property without that person’s consent, yet you have taken God’s woman without his consent for sexual sin, how then are you not a thief?

The eighth commandment: “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.” And you stand with the devil *against* your Savior and testify by your deeds that he is not your God. For Saint Paul says in Titus 1:16 that sinners “confess that they know God, but by their works they deny him.”

The ninth commandment: “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house, nor his wife.” And when you desire any woman sexually, you desire the house of Christ, your neighbor, for Christ wants to dwell in that house forever. That woman belongs to Christ by creation and by his blood of redemption. And if she is good, and you desire her, then you are desiring the true wife of Christ; for every soul that lives in God’s grace without deadly sin is a true bride of Christ, especially if she is chosen for eternal salvation.

The tenth commandment: “You shall not covet anything that belongs to your neighbor.” And you covet, as has been said, Christ’s woman, who is your neighbor, being human. For Saint Augustine says: every human being is neighbor to every human being.

This teaching is confirmed by the words of Saint James in his epistle, chapter 2 verse 10, where he says: “Whoever is guilty of one point of the law is guilty of all.” That is: whoever has broken one commandment is guilty of all, for he keeps none of them truly.

I would like every person to learn and remember this saying, because it seems to me that people would more readily avoid deadly sins if they thought about it. And for that, Christ’s teaching in today’s reading helps us a great deal, where he shows that the seed—the word of God—falls among four kinds of people, and in only one kind it remains and bears fruit.

Notice here why the word of God is called seed. First, because just as the earth is useful because it brings forth seed and yields a harvest, and so is precious for the sake of its seed, in the same way the word of God makes the human heart precious to God. Therefore the Savior says that the good soil are those who, with a good and best heart, hear the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit in suffering and perseverance.

Second, because from one grain many grains grow, and in the same way from the word of God many sons and daughters of God are born. About this Christ says in Matthew 13:8 that some seed brought a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

Third, because if people did not sow seed, they would die; if they did not sow, they would have nothing to eat and would die of hunger. In the same way, if the word of God is not sown, it leads people to spiritual death. Therefore Isaiah says in chapter 1 verse 9: “If the Lord of hosts had not left us a few survivors like seed, we would have been like Sodom and like Gomorrah”—that is, now in sin and afterward in torment. The citizens of Gomorrah and Sodom had plenty to eat and drink, they were at ease, and they had no one who would preach to them; therefore, by their silent sins they died spiritually.

From this you can see how useful it is to sow the word of God. Since this seed, the word of God, is the food by which the inner person—the soul—is fed and kept alive so that it grows up into the sonship of God in a dignity beyond measure, it is clear that it is very useful and worthy that this seed be sown and received.

So Christ, in order to scatter this seed, “went out” from the Father; he became flesh so that he might sow this seed. He himself is the one of whom he says, “A sower went out to sow his seed.” And because the seed is the word of God, and he is God, he showed by this reading that he is God who came forth from the life of the Virgin Mary “to sow his seed.” He is the true and first sower. Others are only sowing tools through whom he sows. Therefore he said to his disciples in Matthew 10:20: “It is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking in you.” That is: it is not from yourselves that you have the truth you speak; it is from the Holy Spirit, and so from the whole Holy Trinity.

So, dear brother, if you despise me as an unclean seed-bag and a stinking basket, do not for that reason reject the seed of the word of God—for God is sowing it to you through this basket. Therefore Christ says in Luke 10:16: “Whoever rejects you, rejects me”—that is, when someone refuses to listen to what Christ commands through his messengers.

Here is another reason why the preaching and hearing of God’s word is so useful and worthy: the Son of God himself sowed—that is, preached. Among all his works he was most diligent in preaching. He baptized only a few. He celebrated the Mass only once, when he wanted to finish his life. But he began to preach at the age of twelve, when he was in the temple teaching the teachers, as Luke 2:46 tells us. Later, beginning at about thirty years of age, he preached for three years and some months until his death. He was crucified because of his preaching. After he rose from the dead, he again preached to his disciples. And as he was ascending into heaven, as his final command he said to them in Mark 16:15: “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.” From his example we see clearly how great the benefit of preaching God’s truth is.

There is yet another reason: the serving of the Mass, the consecration of bread so that it becomes the body of Christ, makes the bread to be God’s body—but that will not last forever. However, worthy preaching can bring a soul into a kind of union with God and with Christ in grace, so that the soul becomes “in-Godded,” and it can remain with him forever.

By keeping his word there comes about three kinds of kinship with Christ, as Christ himself says in Matthew 12:50: “Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my mother, my sister, and my brother.” And he values this spiritual kinship more than bodily kinship. He spoke those words once during a sermon when someone said to him, as we read in Matthew 12:47, “Your father and your mother are looking for you.” And he immediately answered in Matthew 12:48, 50: “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers? Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my mother, my sister, and my brother.”

Likewise, when one woman praised him and his mother, saying in Luke 11:27: “Blessed is the womb that carried you, and the breasts that nursed you,” he again valued more highly the spiritual birth that comes from hearing the word of God worthily. He answered, “Yes indeed”—that is, it is true—but then added, “Blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it,” that is, who keep it fully. These are the good soil in which the word of God, that seed, falls and bears fruit.

But for the soil of our hearts to be good, it must have five virtues in it.

First, just as the earth has firmness and stability and stands where God has placed it, so the soil of our hearts must have steadfastness of faith.

Second, the earth has cohesion; all the soil wants to stay together. In the same way we must have love toward one another so that we may all be together in grace.

Third, the earth is cold; we must be gentle and cool of spirit, extinguishing the fires of anger.

Fourth, the earth is dry; in eating and drinking we must be moderate.

Fifth, the earth has weight, and always draws downward; we must have humility against pride, so that we do not puff ourselves up and rise with the devil.

If we had these, we would be the good soil of which Christ speaks in the reading. And because he wants us to remember this well, he said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.” Saint Gregory says about this: “Remember what is being said: ‘Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.’” And he adds: “Be diligent that the word you have received may remain in the ear of your heart. Be diligent that the seed does not fall along the path, that the evil spirit may not come and take the word out of your memory.” So says Gregory.

There is yet another remarkable saying of Christ here: he calls riches “thorns.” And not without reason, but because they choke the word of God; they hinder both the preaching and the hearing of it, and especially the keeping of it. For Christ says: “Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it”—that is, many possessions choked the word of God.

Saint Gregory says here: “Dearest brothers! If we called riches ‘thorns,’ perhaps you would not believe us. Who would believe me if I explained that wealth is thorns—especially since thorns prick, and riches delight?” But indeed riches are thorns, for with many thoughts they tear at the mind. That is Gregory’s meaning. He agrees with what Christ says: riches are thorns because by great anxieties they tear the human heart, and in that heart they choke the word of God.

Riches will prick a person in this life, at death, at judgment, and in hell.

In this world they prick him three ways: in gaining, in keeping, and in losing. He gains them with difficulty, keeps them with difficulty, and loses them with pain.

At death they prick him because he does not want to die away from them, and he cannot take them with him. He twists and turns in his mind: “To whom will they go?”

At judgment they will pierce him, for Christ will say to the rich, Matthew 25:41–42: “I was hungry and you did not give me anything to eat; I was thirsty and you did not give me anything to drink. Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire!”

Then in hell they will pierce forever—like that rich man who did not feed poor Lazarus and was buried in hell.

From this may dear Christ keep us!
