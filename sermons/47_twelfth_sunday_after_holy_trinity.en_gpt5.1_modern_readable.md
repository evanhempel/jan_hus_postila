# Twelfth Sunday After Holy Trinity

Gospel reading: Mark 7:31–37.

“At that time Jesus left the region of Tyre, came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, into the region of the Decapolis. They brought to him a man who was deaf and mute, and they begged him to lay his hand on him. Jesus took him aside, away from the crowd. He put his fingers into the man’s ears, and after spitting he touched his tongue. Then he looked up to heaven, sighed, and said, *Efeta!*—that is, ‘Be opened!’ Immediately his ears were opened, the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke correctly. And Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone. But the more he ordered them, the more they proclaimed it. And people were utterly astonished, saying, ‘He has done everything well: he makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.’”

In this holy reading we see Jesus, we see a man who is deaf and mute, we see the people who bring him to Jesus, and we see those who go out and tell others about what Jesus has done, praising all his works.

In Jesus we should notice his diligence and his mercy—how tirelessly he walked and preached out of compassion. And we should notice his great power, by which he “has done everything well,” and so believe firmly that he is true God and true man: God, because he has done all things well; man, because he went about, laboring and preaching on foot.

The reading says: “Jesus left the region of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis.”

Know this: Tyre is a city; Sidon is another city. Galilee is a Jewish land, a region where Christ was born and raised; that is why he was called “the Galilean.” The Sea of Galilee is named after that region. And the Decapolis is another land, where at the time of Christ’s preaching many Gentiles lived.

So already you see the diligence and mercy of our Savior in his preaching—and so, the care for our salvation—that he walked on foot through the regions, preaching.

Matthew writes (9:35): “Jesus went through all the towns and strongholds, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the message about the kingdom, and healing every disease and every kind of sickness.” And he did this out of mercy, as Matthew shows immediately after (9:36): “When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were troubled like sheep that have no shepherd.”

Saint Gregory ties this word to his preaching and says that Christ visited his people like a faithful shepherd visiting his sheep, to lay down his life for them. So on that word of Christ, “I am the good shepherd” (John 10:11), he says: The Lord did what he urged others to do; he showed what he commanded; he laid down his life for the sheep and gave his body to his sheep to redeem them and feed them with his own flesh.

O courageous sons of Christ, consider the mercy of your Savior: that, though he is God, he took flesh to serve us faithfully; that by a bitter, shameful, and cruel death he cleansed us from sin and delivered us from the devil and from eternal misery. And so he preached in the regions of Tyre, Sidon, the Decapolis, and others.

When he was in that region of the Decapolis, the reading says: “They brought to him a man who was deaf and mute, and they begged him to lay his hand on him.”

This man was not deaf and mute by nature; the devil had taken away both his hearing and his speech. The clever devil took from this man two senses most necessary for salvation: hearing—so that he would not hear the Word of God and so would not be saved; and speech—so that he could not receive counsel for salvation from his neighbor or give it to others, could not pray, and could not speak about God.

According to the explanation of Saint Bede, this man represents people on whom God has mercy and who are to be delivered from the devil’s power. For a person became deaf when, refusing to obey God’s command, he accepted the devil’s word; and so he became mute, when he ceased to praise God. Deafness and muteness began with the first man, and they have greatly spread in his offspring, so that now there are very many who do not obey God and so are truly deaf.

To them God speaks through Isaiah (42:18): “You deaf, hear!” And then he says (Isaiah 42:19): “Who is deaf, if not the one to whom I sent my messengers?” God sent prophets; he sent even his Son. The Son sent his messengers, the apostles. Christ himself, speaking with bodily lips, preached and confirmed the Scripture we are to hear. And yet we are so deaf that rarely is a person found who keeps God’s commandment in deed.

Therefore God says, “You deaf, hear!”—you who have ears and do not hear.

How deaf is the one who does not hear that Jesus, crying with a great voice on the cross, gave up his life for him! How deaf is the one in whose ears these words do not ring: “Rise, come to judgment!” (Isaiah 41:1), and again: “Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire!” (Matthew 25:41).

By nature, everyone who is deaf is also mute. Because he cannot hear from birth, he cannot learn to speak, and so muteness follows deafness. In the same way, whenever a person falls into mortal sin, at once he is spiritually born of the devil in that sin. As long as he remains deaf, he will remain mute; and he remains deaf as long as he is in mortal sin; therefore as long as he is in mortal sin, he is also mute: deaf, because he does not obey God; mute, because he does not praise him.

So all in mortal sin are like idols, of which David the prophet says (Psalm 115:5–6) that “they have mouths but will not speak, they have eyes but will not see, they have ears but will not hear.”

And even though laypeople—those who are not priests—when struck down by mortal sin are deaf and mute to their own condemnation unless Jesus restores them to inner hearing of his word and to worthy speech, yet with this same muteness both the clergy and the laity are stricken.

Many priests, though they know how to speak much from the holy Scripture, as learned masters, and from papal laws, as trained lawyers, are still mute in God’s sight. Because they live badly, they do not truly pray in a way fitting their office, they do not truly praise God, and they do not truly teach others.

So the Savior says of them in Matthew 15: “This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines human commandments.”

In this group are all who value human commands and human rules more than God’s commands, and all who do not teach God’s law to the people though they are appointed to teach. These are the mute dogs of whom God says through Isaiah (56:10): “Its watchmen are blind, they all lack knowledge; they are all mute dogs, unable to bark.”

And who are these watchmen and shameless dogs? Isaiah immediately explains (56:11): “Those shepherds have no understanding; they have all turned to their own way, each to his own greed, from the greatest to the least.”

So God himself tells us who the mute, shameless dogs are: greedy shepherds, starting from the greatest—from the greatest lover of money and the most shameless dog—down to the very least little shepherd-dog who is mute and shameless.

How many of these mute dogs there are today, and how few true shepherds! If you doubt it, remember that God said: “Her watchmen”—that is, the watchmen of the vineyard, which is the people of God—“are all mute dogs, unable to bark.”

Why? Surely because in some of them greed has stopped their mouths, and in others ignorance of God’s law has done the same. For God says at once: “Those shepherds have no understanding”—that is, they do not understand the Scripture. So you see that ignorance has stopped their mouths. And about greed he says right away: “They have all turned to their own way, each to his own greed, from the greatest to the least.”

The greatest has turned to his greed, which is simony—selling spiritual offices: archbishoprics, bishoprics, provostships, abbacies, canonries and parishes, indulgences and dispensations. And since, as the father is, so are the sons, and merchants do not give away goods for free, the trade in greed runs down to the very last, who may be some greedy little parish priest or chaplain who looks for earthly profit in hearing confessions, in baptizing, in the sacraments, in preaching, in “thirty masses,” and in other ministries.

Because there are many of that sort and few faithful workers of Christ, the loving, faithful, and diligent Shepherd says to his disciples (Matthew 9:37–38): “Truly, the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.”

On this word Saint Gregory says (Homily 17): “Let us hear what the Lord says when he sends preachers: ‘Truly, the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.’ We cannot speak of this without deep sorrow. For though there are many who would like to hear good things, there are few who will declare them. The world is full of priests, yet in God’s harvest a true worker is very rarely found. We accept the priestly office, but we do not carry out the work of that office.

“So, my brothers, consider what is said: ‘Ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.’ You should pray for us, that we may be able to speak to you what is fitting, that our tongue may not be lazy in exhorting you; that since we have accepted the office of preaching, our silence may not condemn us before the righteous Judge.”

All this is from Saint Gregory the pope, who confesses that he is bound to preach.

Who then can heal these deaf and mute ones? Only Jesus—of whom the reading says: “They brought to him a man who was deaf and mute, and they begged him to lay his hand on him.”

Know that there are many things that lead a sinner to Jesus.

First, the grace of God, by which he draws to himself whom he wills. As David says (Psalm 73:24): “By your will you have led me.”

Second, the Word of God, when sinners hear it. No one is brought from their old ways to Jesus unless they hear the Word of God. So Saint Paul says (Romans 10:14): “How will they believe if they do not hear? And how will they hear without a preacher?” And again (Romans 10:17): “Faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word.”

Third, sickness leads a person to Jesus. David says (Psalm 16:4): “Their pains have been multiplied, and they have hastened”—that is, to God. And we see this with our own eyes: many, while they are healthy, pay little attention to Jesus; but when a serious sickness comes, then they confess their sins and ask for the body of Jesus.

Fourth, fear of death leads to Jesus, as we see in those who are ill.

Fifth, the troubles and oppositions of this world.

Sixth, good company.

Seventh, a good example.

Eighth, devout prayer, which especially brings healing to the sick.

This we see in the reading: “They brought to him the deaf and mute man and begged him to lay his hand on him.” They begged him, and he heard them and healed the man. And how?

The reading says that Jesus “took him aside from the crowd, put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting touched his tongue. Then he looked up to heaven, sighed, and said, *Efeta!* that is, ‘Be opened!’”

Notice that three things came before this man’s healing: he was brought; others prayed; and he was led out of the crowd. So when a sinner is to be healed, there must first be: bringing him to Jesus, prayer, and leading him out of bad company.

When these three are there, then Jesus “puts his fingers into his ears”—that is, he gives the gifts of the Holy Spirit into the hearing of the sinner. Saint Gregory says: “To put the fingers into the ears is to open the mind of the deaf through the gifts of the Holy Spirit.”

Thus Jesus put his fingers into the ears of the deaf man—that is, he gave him the gifts of the Holy Spirit so that he would hear what he must hear.

“And after spitting, he touched his tongue”—with spittle. Saint Gregory says that spittle signifies wisdom. He means the wisdom of the Son of God and says: “The spittle taken from the mouth of our Redeemer is the wisdom given in holy Scripture; for spittle flows from the head to the mouth. And so, that wisdom which he himself is, when it touches our tongue, at once opens it to preach the words of God.”

Then: “He looked up to heaven and sighed.” He did this to show that the healing of such a person belongs to the power of the God of heaven, and to show that he would do it by God’s power and also that he is true man. He sighed to show his compassion and the lifting up of his heart to God. He also sighed to show the heaviness of sin and to teach us to sigh.

Then “he said, *Efeta!*”—in the Jewish tongue—“that is: ‘Be opened!’”

Because he commanded as a mighty God, “immediately his ears were opened,” for every creature must obey him: doing what he commands, or enduring what he wills. “And the bond of his tongue was loosed.” First his ears were opened, and then his tongue was loosed. And he spoke only to the ears: “Be opened!” He did not say to the tongue, “Be loosed!”

Saint Gregory says: “In this we must understand that the word ‘Be opened!’ was spoken for the opening of the ears. For when the ears of the heart are opened to obedience, then at once the bond of the tongue is loosed, so that, hearing the good that he does, he also tells it to others while doing it himself.”

Therefore it is rightly added: “And he spoke correctly.” The one who truly speaks correctly is the one who first hears and does what he later, by speaking, teaches others to do.

From this word of Gregory we learn that the one who truly speaks rightly is the one who keeps God’s commands and teaches others to keep them. And the one who speaks wrongly is the one who, being evil, teaches others to be good.

So the Savior says (Matthew 12:34): “How can you speak good things, when you are evil?”

Know that every mortal sin is a bond on the tongue to keep it from speaking rightly. As long as a person is in mortal sin, nothing he says is truly pleasing and precious to God. Therefore God says (Jeremiah 23:28): “Let the one who has my word, speak my word rightly.”

From this you see that every preacher when he preaches, every priest when he prays, and every person who speaks God’s word, if he is in mortal sin, speaks crookedly. Therefore God has forbidden such people to speak his words.

As David says, God says to the sinner (Psalm 50:16–17): “Why do you recite my statutes and take my covenant on your lips? You hate my discipline and have thrown my words behind your back.”

If we babblers would remember this, we surely would be careful not to fall into any mortal sin. Then our tongue would be loosed, so that we could speak rightly, teach others, and pray rightly.

There is also another bond on the tongue: fear. Because of fear many do not dare confess the truth. Priests do not dare to preach; laypeople and women do not dare to confess.

Priests fear that they will lose their income, be thrown into prison, be disgraced, or be killed. Laypeople fear the shame of confessing great sins, or the heavy penance, and also—so I have heard from many—that priests betray people’s confessions.

May the merciful Savior grant that all those bonds be loosed, so that each person may speak rightly according to God’s will.

The reading continues: “And he ordered them not to tell anyone.”

Why does he forbid these people to speak of his kindness, when in other cases he commands people to speak? For example, John’s disciples—after he had healed the sick, he said to them (Luke 7:22): “Go, tell John what you have seen: the blind see, the lame walk, the deaf hear.” And after he had healed a man by casting out demons from him, as Mark writes, when the Savior had driven out the demons from one man, he said to him (Mark 5:19): “Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how he has had mercy on you.”

Know this: because our loving Savior has done all things well, as today’s reading says, he also did well in commanding those people to speak of his works and these people not to speak. To the first he commanded, “Tell,” so that they would say that he did these things by God’s power. To the others he said, “Do not tell,” so that they would not talk as if he had done them by merely human power.

So we also must say that he cast out demons and gave hearing to the deaf as God, not as a mere man.

In this there is a lesson: that people should not preach about Christ what they do not understand, so that they do not attribute error to God.

He also commanded these people not to speak to teach us that when we have done something good, we should not boast of it, knowing that by boasting we would lose all eternal reward.

Saint Remigius says: “Why did the Lord forbid people to preach about himself? Did he not know that many would have believed through that preaching? But the one who wanted himself to be preached forbade preaching about himself in order to show how great the zeal must be in those to whom the office of preaching is entrusted, since even those preach to whom it was commanded not to preach.”

Therefore the reading says at once: “The more he ordered them, the more they proclaimed it, and therefore they marveled all the more, saying, ‘He has done everything well; he makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.’”

Because these people preached the truth about Christ and glorified him by telling of his works, and because they did it from a good desire, they did not really break Christ’s command, and Christ did not rebuke them.

So I also trust in his holy mercy that he will not rebuke me because I preach against the command of my prelates. For I know that his command is better. By his command he has bound me to preach, giving me the gift of understanding and speech, and the desire to do it. Above all, I trust his mercy that he has received me into the priesthood and into the office of preaching.

He, the merciful one, who has done all things well—above all that he has powerfully created human beings, wisely redeemed sinners, and out of immeasurable mercy prepared for people blessedness, which is the satisfying of the will without lack—he has done well in giving the deaf the power to hear, the mute the power to speak, and then giving speech so that he spoke rightly.

By these three works he showed the power of God the Father, the wisdom of God the Son, and the goodness of the Holy Spirit. For no good work is done by only one person of the Godhead; what the Son does, the Father and the Holy Spirit also do, as Saint Augustine says. Therefore from every work there should be praise to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: to the Father, because he acts powerfully; to the Son, because he acts wisely; and to the Holy Spirit, because he acts willingly and graciously.

Thus each person of the Trinity, and so the holy Trinity as one God, has done well all that has been created. Therefore let us praise the mighty God, saying that he has done all things well; and therefore all things are good, insofar as they have been made by his holy mercy.
