# Second Sunday After Christmas

St. Luke, chapter 2, verses 42–52.

At the time when Jesus was twelve years old, his parents went up to Jerusalem for the feast, as was the custom for the great festival of Passover. When the days of the feast were finished and they started back home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his father and mother did not know it. Thinking he was with the group on the road, they traveled a whole day; then they began looking for him among their relatives and acquaintances. When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. Everyone who heard him was amazed—struck with awe—at his understanding and his answers. When his parents saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been searching for you in great sorrow.” He said to them, “Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in the things that belong to my Father?” But they did not understand what he was saying to them. Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and he was subject to them. And his mother kept all these words, storing them up in her heart. And Jesus grew in age and in wisdom, and in favor with God and with people.

St. Luke, taught by the Virgin Mary, lays out clearly the deeds of Christ in his youth when he writes that, when Jesus was twelve, he went up to the Passover feast in Jerusalem with Mary and Joseph. For all Jewish boys were supposed to go up to Jerusalem for three feasts, as it is written in Exodus 23:17. But those who lived far away were excused from some; they were required to come at least once, for the great feast when they ate the lamb. And so Jesus, as the reading says, went up to Jerusalem; and by the eternal plan of God, when the feast days were over, he remained in the temple, to teach the holy Church—and especially to teach bishops and priests how, after celebrating the sacred service, they ought to be diligent in teaching for the benefit of the Church.

But tragically, today’s bishops and priests—especially canons and idle holders of altars—cannot wait for the service of God to end so they can hurry off to the tavern, and others rush who knows where, into ways of life unfit for priests, and, sad to say, even to dancing! And monks, when a new Mass is celebrated, arrange dances for it—faithless servants of the devil, new Judases! They do not remember that the Lord Jesus, when he celebrated the Mass, giving his body and blood to his disciples, said to them (Luke 22:40): “Pray, and you will not fall into temptation.” Then he went with them—not to a dance, but to pray; not to worldly laughter, but to sweat blood in agony. And Judas, greedy for money, ran off to get silver so he could betray his Master.

In the same way, many today, like savage beasts tearing at the body of the Son of God, run—one to greed, another to sexual sin, another to drunkenness, another to dancing, another to hunting that should be closed to priests. So those who ought to be the first to follow Christ are the first to stand against Christ! Therefore our dear Savior, when he entered Jerusalem on a donkey, began by striking the priests with a whip, because of their greed and their dishonoring of the house of God.

In this way he began to teach priests and teachers, even when he was just twelve years old, as this reading shows.

Because men and women traveled in separate groups to and from the feasts, and children could go with either, Joseph assumed Jesus was with his mother, and she assumed he was with Joseph. So they went on ahead without him. The next day, not knowing where Jesus was, they searched for him among relatives and acquaintances, not realizing he had stayed in Jerusalem to teach the teachers in the temple. After three days they found him—not in a tavern, not at a dance, not in some sin, but in the temple, the place appointed for prayer and holy teaching, sitting among the teachers, listening and asking questions, so that he could instruct them, and by his good example lead future teachers and priests to do the same.

“And they all were afraid in astonishment, seeing his wisdom and his answers.” Like a wise judge, he first listened to them; then, when they went astray, he questioned them. Nor did he only ask them questions; when they asked him, he answered. From this it is clear how badly many of today’s masters, doctors, and other priests sin. They do not listen wisely, they do not question wisely, and they do not answer wisely. Instead they act according to their own will and the lies of false witnesses—like those two old priests who condemned Susanna though she was innocent. So these men condemn others; and if any Scripture stands against their customs and their will, they twist it strangely in their explanations.

For example, these words: “Do not store up gold or silver for yourselves” (Matthew 10:9). And: “The rulers of the nations lord it over them, but it must not be so among you” (Matthew 20:25). And: “You received freely; give freely” (Matthew 10:8). Yet our doctors today did not want to answer the bachelors and students—or to teach them, even when begged in God’s name—whether they are bound by God’s command to give money to the pope as his bulls demand, taken from the goods that God has only loaned them.

The reading goes on: “His mother said to him: ‘Son, why have you treated us like this?’” Joseph did not ask, because he believed that Christ is God and he feared to rebuke God. But the mother, moved by natural motherly love—a love that does not bring fear, but a ready boldness—asked the question not to complain that Christ had troubled and saddened them, but to learn for what useful purpose he had done it. She said, “Look, your father and I have been searching for you in grief.” And Jesus, while confirming her question, gently rebuked their lack of understanding, saying, “Didn’t you know that I must be in the things that belong to my Father?”—that is, first and above everything else, even above serving or obeying any created being. Why? Because he came into the world for this very reason: to bear witness to the truth.

From this, mothers and fathers must learn not to hinder their children from serving God. Second, when a child does something, they should first seek the reason why, and not immediately scold and rage. And children must learn not to snap at father or mother, or shout them down. For Christ answered his mother and Joseph humbly: “Why were you looking for me?”

Everyone has a lesson here, but especially prelates: they must value the spiritual good of the holy Church more than any worldly interest, and they must obey God more than any human. See: against the will of his earthly father and mother, Jesus fulfilled the will of his heavenly Father; by this he taught that whenever anyone understands that God wills one thing and father or mother another, they must fulfill the will of God. Here the father and mother wanted Jesus not to remain in the temple; God the Father wanted him to remain in the temple. Therefore Jesus says he had to be there, teaching the teachers, as his heavenly Father had commanded.

Against this holy teaching, people are generally opposed—especially many priests—who value human commands more than God’s commands, and so obey men more readily than God. In this way priests have misled people with the idea of “obedience,” so that many say and preach that whatever the pope commands, people must do or believe, as though the pope could not fall into error. They refuse to remember that many popes have been heretics, and that once a woman was pope for two years and three months. She was born in Mainz and called Agnes; when she took the papal office she used the name Johannes. And as she was processing from St. Peter’s to the Lateran, she gave birth to a child. The devil put her and her lover into the papal place because she was learned, and God allowed it for our benefit, so that we would not immediately call “holy” anyone who holds a bishopric or the papal throne.

Others say this: “Even if a superior—whether a bishop or the pope—commands something evil, the inferior must still obey, because the sin will belong to the one who commands, not to the one who obeys.” This is the devil’s arrow. With it he would draw everyone into obedience to himself, not caring that he himself is guilty as he drags people into sin. Therefore neither the one who commands evil nor the one who obeys will be without guilt. For the Savior says (Matthew 15:14): “If a blind man leads a blind man, they will both fall into a pit.” And Christ says this about prelates who, for the sake of their own regulations, were breaking the commandments of God.

The reading continues: “They did not understand the word he spoke to them.” Mary and Joseph were not yet able fully to grasp the mystery of God with their human understanding. As the commentary says, the mighty God made himself little so that, growing up among the little ones, he might gradually lead them to accept the truth of his mysteries. So do not be surprised that the Virgin Mary did not know many things and did not understand many of Christ’s sayings.

Then it says: “He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and he was subject to them.” In Latin it says, “he went down” with them, because Jerusalem is higher in elevation than Nazareth. But this can also be taken spiritually: his “going down” shows his humbling of himself. Therefore the interpreter rightly says, “he went down and humbled himself and was subject to them.” St. Bernard comments on the word “them”: To whom was he subject? God to human beings! See—God was subject to a human! So, human being, be ashamed to be proud, when for your sake God has become humble.

In this way Jesus fulfilled all righteousness—that is, perfect humility—by submitting himself in obedience to those who were lower than he. And this obedience, says St. Ambrose, was not forced but voluntary and full of grace.

Here Jesus also teaches children that they must not only obey their parents but honor them. For God says in the commandment (Exodus 20:12): “Honor your father and your mother.” Honor them by holding them in respect. Honor them by giving what they need if they are in poverty. Honor them by obeying them in worthy matters, as St. Paul says to the Colossians (3:20): “Children, obey your parents in everything”—understand this to mean in all things that belong to outward respect and to the ordering of the household, and that are not against God.

Therefore children are not bound to obey parents in absolutely everything. If a father or mother tells a daughter to marry, and she would rather remain a virgin for God, she is not bound to obey in that. Likewise, if they order her to remain unmarried and she would rather marry, again she is not bound in conscience. The same with a son: perhaps his father tells him to become a monk or a priest, but he sees that this state in life does not fit him; he is not bound to obey in that. Nor even if the pope commands it. Again, if the pope or a father told Peter to sell everything he owned and give it for God’s sake, Peter would not be bound in conscience to obey that—though it is indeed the counsel of God to sell everything, give to the poor, and follow Christ. But because perhaps that counsel would not be fitting for Peter in his situation, he would not be under mortal sin if he did not obey his father or the pope in that matter.

Someone may object: “Since it is God’s counsel to do such things, and God cannot give a bad counsel, just as he cannot err, how then does Peter, or anyone else, not sin by not following God’s counsel?” I answer: he does sin, but in a lesser, everyday way; for counsel does not bind under mortal sin the way a commandment does; it binds under venial sin. Also, not every divine counsel is equally beneficial to every person. For some, marriage fits better than remaining unmarried—since God himself ordained that some should enter marriage, not all remain single. Therefore a person must carefully weigh which state of life suits him better, and ask God to grant him that state. This is what we pray for when we say (Matthew 6:10; Luke 11:2): “Your will be done.”

And as Jesus obeyed not his own will but the will of God the Father—as he says in John 6:38: “I came down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me”—so today’s reading says, “I must be in the things that belong to my Father.” But because it was also the Father’s will that, after obeying his heavenly Father, he should obey his earthly parents, the reading adds: “He was subject to them.”

“And his mother kept all these words, storing them in her heart.” She received them lovingly and deeply, and by them her understanding was enlightened; later she grasped what Christ had meant. In the same way, a faithful soul must act—one that has, if not physically, yet spiritually, given birth to Jesus. For Jesus says (Matthew 12:50; Mark 3:35): “Whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.” Therefore St. Augustine says: If Mary had not first conceived the Son of God in her heart by faith, she would never have conceived him in her womb.

So it is very profitable for a faithful soul to keep the words of God; in this way it becomes the mother of God—that is, the mother of Jesus. For to the woman who praised him, saying (Luke 11:27–28), “Blessed is the womb that carried you, and the breasts that nursed you,” he replied, “Yes, rather, blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it.” As if he were saying, “Woman, it is true that the womb that carried me is blessed; but it would not be blessed merely because it carried me, if she who bore me had not kept the word of God—she who carried me in her womb and fed me at her breasts.” Of her the reading now says: “His mother kept all these words, storing them in her heart.”

The reading continues: “Jesus grew in age”—that is, he grew and advanced in years—“and in wisdom”—that is, in knowledge through his senses, so that with his bodily eyes he came to see things he had not seen before; likewise he came to hear, taste, and touch new things—“and in favor”—which he showed to people. And also, as St. Ambrose says, he grew in wisdom and favor in the sense that he gradually showed his wisdom and grace more and more openly. St. Gregory the Great says he “grew” for others—that is, he made his wisdom and grace bring profit in other people. And this “before God and before people,” so that God would receive glory, and people would receive teaching and salvation from his holy grace.

This is the one who was willing to go up to the temple with his father and mother, to teach the teachers there, then to go back home with his mother, and to be subject in grace to Joseph and the Virgin Mary—though he is the Son of God, the eternal God, blessed forever. May his teaching be our salvation. Amen.
