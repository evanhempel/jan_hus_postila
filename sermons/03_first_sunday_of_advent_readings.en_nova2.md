### Reading for the First Sunday in Advent  

**MATTHEW 21:1–9**  

When Jesus drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, Peter and Philip, saying to them:  
“Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. And if anyone says anything to you, reply, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will let them go at once.”  

This happened so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, he said:  
**“Say to the daughter of Zion:  
Behold, your king comes to you,  
gentle, riding on a donkey,  
on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.”**  

The disciples went and did as Jesus had commanded them. They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and he sat on them. A great multitude spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut down branches from the trees and strewed them on the way. The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted,  
“Hosanna to the son of David!  
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!  
Hosanna in the highest!”  

This reading actually occurred on Palm Sunday, so it is more properly remembered on that day than today. Yet we read it now, recalling his coming, which the Christian assembly commemorates today, called in Czech “Advent” from the Latin word *adventus*, meaning “coming” or “visitation.” The holy Church observes this season from today until Christ’s Nativity, and thus calls the whole period “Advent”—that is, the time in which we remember Christ’s visitation.  

#### Three Visitations of Christ  

Know this: Christ’s visitation occurs in three ways, as Scripture shows:  

1. **The First Visitation: In the Flesh**  
   This is when he visited us by becoming incarnate in the womb of the Virgin Mary, though he was God. Of this, he himself says in John 16:28:  
   **“I came forth from the Father and have come into the world.”**  

2. **The Second Visitation: Spiritual**  
   This is when he visits us through his grace. For he says in John 14:23:  
   **“If anyone loves me, they will keep my words, and my Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.”**  
   Christ means that he and the Father will come to the person who loves Christ and keeps his commandments. Of this spiritual visitation John also says in Revelation 3:20:  
   **“Here I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to them, and will eat with them, and they with me.”**  

   Christ stands at the door, ready to visit with his grace. He knocks when he warnings us through inner promptings, afflictions, fears, illnesses, or the giving of various gifts. Whoever hears his voice and opens the door—who renounces sin and turns fully to do his will—Christ will enter, visit them with his grace, and if they remain in that grace, never returning to sin, Christ will sup with them, and they with him. That is, they will partake in eternal joy.  

   Thus Christ spiritually visits a person: when they abandon mortal sins, he forgives them; when he enriches them with special grace; and when at death he comes to them with his grace. He also visits the wicked with terror, punishment, and eternal damnation, especially at death. For Matthew 24:42 says:  
   **“Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.”**  
   And in Revelation 3:3:  
   **“If you do not watch, I will come upon you like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come upon you.”**  

3. **The Third Visitation: The Final Judgment**  
   This is the coming spoken of by Christ in Matthew 25:31–32:  
   **“When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory, and before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.”**  

   Of this coming we also say in the Creed: “He shall come to judge the living and the dead.”  

From this you see that the first visitation happened once, when he was uniquely incarnated. The second occurs daily, as he daily visits the faithful with his grace, and the wicked with punishments or warnings. The third is yet to come, and shall occur only once.  

### How We Should Respond  

For the first visitation we must be profoundly grateful and gladly recall it. For the second, we must be diligent that he may dwell with us, and that on the day of his Nativity he may visit us with special grace. For the third, we must eagerly await it, for he strictly commands us to watch—that is, to keep ourselves from sin and to grow in God’s grace.  

For these three visitations, the holy Church has established that from today onward we should prepare ourselves more diligently than ever in virtue, remembering that he came in the flesh for our salvation, that he will specially visit us with his grace on the day of his Nativity, and that at the last day he will come to give us eternal kingdom.  

### Threefold Preparation  

There are three ways to prepare for these visitations:  

1. **Revere the Coming of Our Lord**  
   As Isaiah 1:16–17 says:  
   **“Cease to do evil, learn to do good.”**  
   And as David says in Psalm 34:15 and 37:27:  
   **“Turn away from evil and do good.”**  

2. **Prepare a Place for Him**  
   That is, cleanse our souls from sin. For Isaiah 1:16 commands:  
   **“Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes.”**  

   We must also clothe ourselves in glorious garments. Isaiah 52:1 says:  
   **“Put on your beautiful garment, O Jerusalem, the holy city.”**  

   Here “Jerusalem” means the assembly of the faithful—the holy city where Christ the King shall dwell forever. This city must clothe itself in garments of festivity—that is, in virtues—which make a person glorious. This clothing is infinitely more excellent for each soul than all the garments of this world worn by the body. No virtue adorns a person better than holy clothing, and this clothing must be spotless—untainted by sin.  

3. **Provide Worthy Nourishment**  
   The nourishment Christ desires is the fulfillment of his will. He himself says in John 4:34:  
   **“My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to finish his work.”**  
   And again in John 6:27:  
   **“Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you.”**  

   Those who prepare this imperishable food are they who do God’s will and persevere in it, for they shall partake in divine blessedness forever. Thus faithful Christians nourish Christ daily when they keep his commandments. On the day of judgment he himself will acknowledge this, saying to the righteous in Matthew 25:35:  
   **“I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink.”**  

### Augustine’s Warning  

Therefore, let us prepare ourselves to worthily remember his first holy visitation, to prepare for the second, and to stand ready for the third. As Saint Augustine says in a sermon:  
“Dearest brothers! By God’s grace the days are upon us in which we seek to sanctify Christ’s Nativity; therefore I urge and admonish you to labor as best we can so that on that day, with a clean conscience, great diligence, and a pure heart and body, we may approach God’s altar, and receive his body and blood—not to judgment, but to the healing of our souls and to salvation. For our life depends in Christ’s body, as he himself says in John 6:53:  
**‘Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.’**  

Therefore, change your life, whoever desires to receive life; for if you do not change your life, you will receive life for judgment, and you will be harmed rather than helped. How blessed is the soul which, with God’s help, has arranged its life so that it is worthy to receive Christ as a guest! And how miserable is the conscience, stained with evil deeds, that Christ cannot dwell in, but wherein the devil begins to reign!”  

### Our Response  

From all this, as Saint Paul also commands in today’s Epistle (Romans 13:12), let us “lay aside the works of darkness”—that is, abandon sins which lead to eternal darkness—and “put on the armor of light”—that is, embrace the virtues which lead us to eternal light.  

Living thus, we shall worthily remember Christ’s threefold visitation: we shall be worthy now to be visited by his special grace, then at death, and finally on the day of judgment. He has already visited us in his incarnation; let us remember that this visitation has already occurred. He visited us with his grace in baptism, cleansing us from sin; and though we have sinned after baptism, he visits us with grace in repentance. For those who have not committed mortal sin after baptism, he visits them with special grace and continues to do so.  

The third visitation we await on the day of judgment, watching for which we must always be ready, for he himself says in Luke 12:40 and Matthew 25:13:  
**“Be ready, for at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man is coming.”**  

We must be ready to endure whatever befalls us lovingly for the sake of our dear Savior Christ, who for our sins—though he owed us nothing and we were his enemies—voluntarily suffered a cruel death. To that death he came willingly to Jerusalem and rode in on a donkey, weeping over Jerusalem, showing the people his merciful visitation.  

Therefore today’s reading speaks of spiritual visitation, through which he visited the faithful by his holy sufferings: not to take away their riches or crush them, but to redeem them from death and give them eternal kingdom. Therefore the prophet Zechariah proclaims, Zechariah 9:9, saying to the holy Church:  
**“Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!  
Behold, your king comes to you;  
just and having salvation,  
humble, and riding on a donkey,  
on a colt, the foal of a donkey.”**  

In these words the prophet comforts the holy Church, saying: “Behold, your king”—a king merciful in vengeance, mighty in defense, wise in guidance, rich in reward. He says “your” king, for he created you, sustains you, protects you from the devil, redeemed you by his death, loved you unto death, and will give you eternal kingdom, for which you shall finally be grateful.  

Therefore the prophet says: “Behold, your king comes to you”—he has come, “just,” who rewards each according to their merit; “having salvation,” for he came to save, as he himself says in John 3:16–17:  
**“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.”**  

Now you have his testimony: he was sent by the Father into this world not to judge the world, but to save the world—that is, the elect chosen for salvation from the world. For he will not judge them to eternal condemnation.  

Therefore the prophet says to the holy Church: “Behold, your king comes to you, just and having salvation!” and “humble,” that he might enrich you in your poverty, as Saint Paul says in 2 Corinthians 8:9:  
**“For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.”**  

Know this: now in virtues, then in heavenly joy. For this reason he came humble “on a donkey,” as today’s reading testifies, which I will not now explain in full, for it is better to reserve it for Palm Sunday, when it actually occurred. And also, so I may not lengthen this discourse further.  

### Conclusion  

Therefore, dearest brothers and sisters! Have enough of this, and prepare yourselves for the second and final visitation, loathing sins, growing in virtue, completing repentance, and eagerly desiring his visitation with all your hearts.  

**The Second Sunday in Advent follows.**
