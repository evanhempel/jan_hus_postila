# Second Sunday After Holy Trinity

Luke 14:16–24

Jesus told this parable: “There was a man  
[Christ] who prepared a great banquet  
[he especially prepared eternal joy]  
and invited many guests  
[all people, through inner enlightenment].  

When it was time for the banquet  
[the time of the Son of God’s incarnation],  
he sent his servant  
[the company of preachers]  
to tell those who had been invited to come  
[leaving their sins and clothing themselves in virtue],  
because everything was now ready  
[Christ has already been offered, so everything needed for eternal joy is prepared].  

But they all alike began to make excuses  
[those who love earthly things more than heavenly joy].  

The first said, ‘I’ve just bought a field  
[I’ve found pride],  
and I have to go and see it  
[driven by desire I must step off God’s path];  
please excuse me  
[cover for me, pray to God for me, I’m just a sinful man].  

Another  
[the greedy man]  
said, ‘I’ve bought five yoke of oxen,  
and I’m on my way to try them out;  
please excuse me.’  

Another  
[the sexually immoral man]  
said, ‘I just got married  
[I’ve agreed to sexual sin],  
and so I can’t come  
[forced by evil desire].’  

The servant came back  
[returned to the banquet from his labor]  
and reported all this  
[their excuses and hardness of heart]  
to his master.  

Then the owner of the house  
[Christ], angry that they refused such a banquet,  
said to his servant  
[through inner instruction],  
‘Go quickly  
[don’t delay—go preach]  
into the streets and alleys of the town  
[of this world]  
and bring in the poor  
[those despised in this world],  
the crippled  
[weak in understanding],  
the blind  
[blinded by sin],  
and the lame  
[the lazy, and those who want to be good and evil at the same time],  
and bring them here  
[into my house, to the banquet].’  

‘Sir,’ the servant said,  
‘What you ordered has been done  
[I’ve brought them],  
but there’s still room  
[more can still enter].’  

Then the master told his servant,  
‘Go out to the roads and along the hedges  
[wherever you possibly can],  
and *compel* them  
[with threats and with power]  
to come in  
[so that they really do enter],  
so that my house will be full  
[so that the number of the elect in heavenly joy will be complete].  

I tell you  
[I, who cannot lie],  
not one of those who were invited  
[and finally refused to accept the invitation]  
will taste my banquet  
[the joy of heaven].’

In this holy reading, our Savior shows us three things:  
his generosity, his diligence, and human ingratitude.

His generosity: he prepared a great banquet.  
His diligence: three times he sent his servant to call people to this great supper.  
Human ingratitude: they all began to make excuses and refused to come.

And listen to that terrifying word at the end, spoken by the One who cannot fail:  
“I tell you, not one of those men who were invited will taste my banquet.”

At the start, the Savior says, “A certain man”—understand this as Christ, who is uniquely human above all others—“prepared,” that is, as God he made ready, “a great banquet,” meaning eternal joy for all the elect, who will sit at his table and feast forever.

He calls that eternal joy a *banquet* (a supper) for several reasons.

First: after supper you don’t eat another meal that day.  
In the same way, after that joy there will be no other joy, nothing beyond it.  
As *Sanctus Gregorius* says, when that joy comes, there is no next joy.

Second: at supper you’re served more delicate, gentle food than at lunch, so you won’t be weighed down.  
That heavenly joy will be the most delightful satisfaction, with no heaviness at all.  
That’s why it’s called a *supper*.

Third: at supper the closest, dearest friends tend to stay; it’s more intimate than lunch.  
In the joy of heaven, only the truly beloved will remain;  
and the ungrateful will never taste that supper, as the reading says.  
So again, it’s rightly called a *supper*.

And it is “great” for several reasons.

First, because of the greatness of the One who prepared it.  
Who could be greater than Christ, true God and true man, King and Lord of the whole world—  
most powerful, most wise, most good, most beautiful, most generous,  
and therefore the most delightful host to those he invites?  
So yes, this is truly a *great* banquet because of such a great Lord.

Second, it’s great because of the greatness of the guests.  
At that banquet there will be holy angels, and also kings and queens.  
And there will be many of them.

Daniel the prophet says (chapter 7, verse 10):  
“Thousands upon thousands served him, and ten times ten thousand stood before him.”  
With such great and such countless guests, can we call it anything but a great banquet?

Don’t let it shake you that Christ also says (Matthew 22:14),  
“Many are invited, but not many are chosen.”  
He means: compared to all those who are invited, the ones chosen for salvation are few.  
There are far more invited than chosen.

Third, the banquet is great because of how richly it’s prepared.  
*Sanctus Paulus* says (2 Corinthians 2, though he’s really echoing 1 Corinthians 2:9):  
“No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has imagined  
what God has prepared for those who love him.”  

So what greater thing can we even imagine than a will completely satisfied, lacking nothing?  
That full satisfaction is prepared for every elect person who, with all their desire, reaches out toward that banquet.

Fourth, the banquet is great because it never ends.  
It is eternal.  
How immense that supper is!

From all this we can see the generosity and the freedom of that “man”  
who prepared this great banquet—not for nothing, but so that it would be enjoyed.

So Jesus continues: “He invited many.”  
He called many—indeed, he called all: both the elect and those foreknown as lost.  
He calls all by an inner light by which he enlightens every human being,  
so that, by nature, we long for heavenly joy.  

Beyond that, he calls some by special gifts, some by pains, labor, and trials,  
and he calls through his written word by the holy prophets.  

And beyond *that*, he sent his servant—  
the company of preachers: the apostles and all true successors.  
They’re called “servant” in the singular because they share one task,  
obey one Lord’s command, and share one intention:  
to call those invited to the banquet in the hour of supper.

That “hour of supper” is the time when the Son of God became human.  
In that time, the sweetness of blessedness—heavenly joy—was made more clearly ready and more eagerly desired.  

And this is what the servants are supposed to tell those invited:  
that they should come prepared, leaving their sins behind and clothing themselves in virtue,  
because everything is ready—there is no lack.

*Sanctus Gregorius* says: “Everything is already ready,  
for since Christ has been sacrificed, the entrance into the kingdom is open.”  
How miserable is the person who has a good road, everything ready, and still refuses to walk to that banquet!

Why doesn’t he value the fact that this “certain man,” Christ—  
powerful God, gentle, more merciful and generous than anyone—  
“prepared a great banquet,”  
eternal joy that shows his overflowing generosity?

This same “one man” gave himself up for sinners,  
to redeem them from sin, from the devil, and from eternal damnation.  

This same “one man” gave himself as food for the sick, to strengthen them;  
for prisoners, to set them free;  
and will give himself as everlasting comfort.  

This man has prepared a great banquet,  
the eternal joy that consists of knowing the Holy Trinity,  
loving the Trinity, and resting in that knowing and loving.  

There, as a person knows God—the holy Trinity—and all things in him,  
they will love God with a whole heart,  
and they will be so completely satisfied in that joy  
that nothing will ever be able to move them away from it.

---

Now, Christ has prepared this banquet and called many,  
but not many have come—or will come.

*Sanctus Gregorius* says in *In om.*:  
“He called many, but not many come.  
Even those who are outwardly subject to him by faith  
often oppose his eternal banquet by the way they live.  
They don’t want to go.”

So Christ continues:  
“They all began, alike, to make excuses”—  
that is, those who love earthly things more than heavenly joy.

The explanation says:  
Everyone who loves earthly things more than heavenly things is making excuses,  
even if he says with his mouth that he plans to go to heavenly joy.  

So when Christ says they “all began to make excuses,”  
he means they refused to do the things that would actually lead them there—  
even though no one, while still alive, dares to say aloud,  
“I don’t want to go to eternal joy.”

The first of these excuse-makers said,  
“I bought a field, and I must go out and see it; please excuse me.”

He represents every proud person who becomes arrogant because of his possessions.  
*Sanctus Augustinus* says that this “field” represents authority and pride.  
So when he says, “I bought a field,” it means, “I’ve embraced pride.”  

This first man stands for all the proud,  
who all delay going to the banquet;  
each one, by his evil actions, refuses to go.

He’s saying in effect,  
“I’ve bought a field—  
I’ve fallen in love with pride,  
and for that I’ve traded away both my soul and the great banquet.  
I *must*—driven by my desire—go out,  
leave God’s path, and go look at it.”  

Pride feeds on being *seen.*  
The proud long to be noticed above others.

“Please,” he says to the servant,  
“have me excused,” meaning: excuse me.  
The interpreter puts it this way:  
“Pray for me, because I’m a sinful man.”

*Sanctus Gregorius* comments:  
“Humility is on his lips,  
but since he refuses to change,  
pride rules in his excuse.”

And you know this yourself.  
Every evil person understands very well when he hears the truth,  
yet even when he sees clearly what he’s doing wrong, he won’t stop.  

When we say to any wicked person,  
“Turn back, follow God, leave the world,”  
we’re inviting him to the Lord’s banquet.  
But when he replies, “Pray for me, I can’t do that,”  
what is he doing except making excuses and asking to be excused?

Next Jesus says,  
“Another said, ‘I’ve bought five pairs of oxen, and I’m going out to test them; please excuse me.’”

This second man represents all the greedy,  
who are burdened under the yoke of covetousness,  
yoking together their five bodily senses  
and turning them toward the wealth of this world.  

This “yoke” is the devil’s harness, along with the world’s ropes,  
binding them so that the devil and the world steer them where they want.

So this man says, “I’m going”—  
meaning, pierced by the devil’s goad—  
“to test them.”

Fool! You buy them first, and *then* test them?  
Just like the first fool: he *buys* the field first, then wants to go inspect it.

And like the first, he says, “Please excuse me.”  
These two sins—pride and greed—come wrapped in many clever, respectable-sounding excuses.  

People don’t so easily recognize when they sin through pride or greed,  
the way they recognize sexual sin.  
With sexual sin, it’s clearer:  
Whenever someone desires another person’s spouse—or any person outside marriage—for the sexual act,  
he has already committed adultery in his heart, and he’s sinned mortally.

That’s why the third man doesn’t bother with a long excuse;  
he represents those who commit sexual sin.

Jesus says:  
“Another said, ‘I’ve just married a wife, and so I can’t come.’  

He has “taken a wife” who has agreed to sexual sin,  
and so he cannot come.  
He offers no other excuse, only this:  
“I can’t come to the banquet because I’ve taken a wife.”

*Sanctus Gregorius* asks,  
“What does the wife represent here except bodily pleasure?  
Yes, marriage is good, established by God’s wisdom for the fruit of children.  
But many use marriage not for fruit,  
but to satisfy bodily desire.”

So this man doesn’t represent holy spouses,  
but every adulterer and every adulteress  
who love sexual sin more than the kingdom of heaven.

I’ve personally heard both priests and laypeople groan,  
saying they “cannot” live without sexual sin,  
even if it meant being damned forever.

Poor blinded little cattle, misled by the devil!  
For a moment of filthy pleasure,  
they’re willing to throw away eternal joy  
and fall into everlasting condemnation.

Truly, many men and women will be damned because of shameful sexual sin.

---

Jesus continues:  
“The servant came back and reported all this to his master.”  

“The servant came back”—  
he returned to the banquet from his labor—  
“and reported everything,”  
that is, all the excuses and hardness of those who were invited.

Many who invite others to the banquet,  
when they see that people refuse to go,  
return from their labor to prayer  
and complain to God that those invited won’t come.  

Not only do *they* speak to the Lord,  
but their very work and the excuses of the people  
“speak” to God against them—  
not because he doesn’t already know,  
but so that the wicked will realize  
their sins and their excuses testify against them.

Then Jesus says,  
“Then the owner of the house became angry”—Christ himself—  
“because they wouldn’t come to such a great banquet,  
and he said,” through inner instruction,  
“to his servant, ‘Go out quickly’”—  
don’t delay; go preach to the common people—  
“into the streets and alleys of the city,” meaning this world,  
“and bring in the poor,”  
those who, though they have some sense, lack possessions  
while others make it to the banquet ahead of them;  

“the crippled”—those who by their natural make-up are slow of mind;  
“the blind”—those blinded by the devil’s teaching in spiritual things;  
“and the lame”—those who won’t walk on God’s road because of laziness;  
“bring them in here,” into my house, to the banquet.

And we can see plainly, as Christ’s words imply,  
that the rich who own fields,  
the strong who plow with oxen,  
and the sexually immoral—often wealthy—  
satisfied with pride, greed, and lust,  
don’t care about eternal joy.  

So God commands that the poor, the weak, the blind, and the lame be called,  
because they have fewer opportunities to sin, and so they more easily come to the banquet.

But spiritually, the poor are those who lack God’s grace and virtue.  
They are also weak, because without grace  
they can’t do any truly good work for their salvation.  

They are blind, because their wickedness blinds them,  
so they don’t truly know God.  

They are lame, because they lack true inner desire toward God  
and toward good works.  
By nature they long for the joy of that eternal banquet,  
but they quickly refuse to leave their sins.

All these the servant—that is, the preacher—must call,  
and lead them by good example and God’s word  
into Christ’s kingdom, to the banquet.

Jesus goes on:  
“The servant said, ‘Lord, what you commanded has been done,  
and there is still room,’  
that is, space for more of the invited to come in.

“Then the master said to the servant,  
‘Go out to the roads and the hedges.’”

By this, the Savior shows that wherever his faithful servant can call people to the banquet,  
he *should* do it.

He commanded this clearly, saying in Matthew 16:  
“Go into all the world and preach to every creature.”  
And it says of the apostles, “They went out and preached everywhere”—  
that is, wherever people were willing to listen.

But sadly, the road of preaching has now been tied up by pride, greed, and envy,  
so God’s word no longer has the freedom it once had.  
Antichrist is spreading his nets, and tightening Christ’s.

Christ told Peter to spread the net for fish,  
and they caught many.  
That catch signified catching souls with the net of God’s word.  

Right after that, Jesus told Peter he would now be catching people—  
and he did, widely—he and the other apostles.

But now Antichrist’s apostles,  
when someone wants to faithfully invite people to the banquet according to God’s command,  
immediately rise up and will not allow it—  
unless that person will preach to their liking,  
praise *them*,  
and never touch their sins.

From this Antichrist’s arsenal,  
the priests together with the Archbishop of Prague, a priest named Zbyněk,  
obtained a *bulla*—a letter with a lead seal—  
which ordered that God’s word be preached nowhere  
except in parish churches, monasteries, and their graveyards.

Against that *bulla*, the Lord put it in my heart to stand up,  
and for the sake of this very Scripture,  
I did not obey that command.  

With his help I preached, even under excommunication and being forbidden the sacraments of a false authority.  
And I still preach, and, if his holy grace allows, I will keep on preaching,  
hoping I might lead some poor, weak, blind, or lame soul  
into Christ’s house, to the banquet.

Before, I preached in the towns and their streets;  
but now I preach among the hedges,  
near the castle called Kozi,  
by the roads between towns and villages.  

For Christ says,  
“Go out to the roads and the hedges [understand: between the hedges]  
and *compel* them to come in,  
so that my house will be full.”  

He says, “Compel”—that is, with the terrors of eternal punishment—  
“so that they may come”—that is, let them go in—  
“so that my house may be filled,”  
that is, so the number of the elect in heavenly joy may be complete.

“But I tell you,” he says—  
I, who cannot fail—  
“none of those men who were invited”  
(and finally refused to come)  
“will taste my banquet,”  
not only will they not feast on it fully—  
they will not even taste it.

How terrible for the proud, the greedy, and the sexually immoral,  
who make such excuses!  

And it’s even worse for the one called “servant,”  
who is supposed to invite others to the banquet,  
yet by his own pride, greed, and sexual sin  
keeps himself away from the banquet—  
who should be calling others, but doesn’t,  
and even blocks those who do call!

---

So now we’ve seen Christ’s generosity, in the greatness of the banquet,  
his great diligence in sending the servant three times,  
and human ingratitude,  
that people would refuse to come to such a great, generous, merciful Lord  
and such a great banquet.

In this reading we also see three kinds of people called to the banquet.

First: those who were invited and refused to come.  
Second: those who came willingly—  
the poor, weak, blind, and lame, whom the servant brought in as the Master commanded.  
Third: those who came under compulsion,  
about whom the Master said, “Compel them to come in.”  

If they could not enter under compulsion,  
the Master would not have commanded the servant to compel them,  
for his house had to be filled.

So here a question arises:

Since the Master says “compel them to come in,”  
is it proper for worldly rulers to compel people in this way  
so that the straying will come to the banquet?

At first it seems the answer is no:

First, because earthly rulers don’t have spiritual authority to compel people to that banquet.  
Second, because no one truly turns to God except voluntarily;  
so a forced coming wouldn’t help those compelled.  
Third, because going to that banquet ought to be free and joyful,  
and every compulsion is unpleasant and against the will.  
How then can something be both free and forced?  
Fourth, because every human has been given free will to choose good or evil;  
so how can that freedom stand together with forced compulsion?

On this question, one thing is clear and certain:  
that it *does* belong to earthly rulers—  
kings, princes, nobles, knights, squires, and city leaders—  
to compel the straying, in an orderly way and from love,  
to go toward that final banquet.  

They have their authority, rule, and sword from God for this very purpose.  

*Sanctus Paulus* proves this plainly in Romans 13:1–4:  

“Every soul”—that is, every human being—  
“must be subject to the higher authorities,  
for there is no authority except from God;  
and the authorities that exist have been established by God.  

So whoever resists the authority—  
where it’s used rightly—  
is resisting what God has arranged,  
and those who resist bring judgment on themselves.  

For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to evil.  
If you don’t want to be afraid of the authority,  
then do what is good, and you’ll receive praise from it,  
for it is God’s servant for your good.  

But if you do evil, be afraid,  
for it does not bear the sword for nothing.  
It is God’s servant, an avenger to bring wrath  
on the one who does evil.”

So says *Sanctus Paulus*.  

He shows clearly that every person must be subject to higher earthly authority,  
and that the ruler bears the sword so that, with power and in proper order,  
he may punish the wicked for God’s glory and push them  
toward keeping God’s law and thus toward the final banquet,  
and at the same time protect the good.

*Sanctus Petrus* agrees in his second epistle, chapter 2:  
“Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority:  
whether to the king as supreme,  
or to governors sent by him  
to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right.”

From Christ’s words, “Compel them to come in,”  
and from the writings of these two apostles and much more Scripture,  
we see that kings, princes, and rulers are God’s servants,  
given authority, power, and the sword  
to defend the good and compel the wicked—  
whether lay or clergy—toward good.  
Both groups are to be subject to higher authority.

But from this very Scripture Antichrist wants to exempt his clergy by human decrees,  
so that now, they claim that no matter how badly a priest lives,  
no earthly ruler may touch him, correct him, or punish him.

But humble Jesus said to the Jewish crowds (John 8:46),  
“Which of you can accuse me of sin?”  

Antichrist, by contrast, says,  
“None of you may accuse *me* of sin!”

Humble Paul, Peter, and the others follow Christ.  
The proud walk after Antichrist.

---

Now back to the first objection:  
“The earthly ruler has no spiritual power to compel toward that banquet.”

I answer: yes he does.  
For this very reason he has income and authority:  
to restrain the wicked by power and protect the good.

We have an example in the Old Testament,  
in the Third Book of Kings (our 1 Kings), chapter 2, verses 26–27 and 35.  
King Solomon removed Abiathar, the highest priest, from the priesthood and office,  
sent him to work his fields,  
and put Zadok the priest in his place.

Second objection:  
“No one turns to God except voluntarily,  
so forced compulsion is useless.”

Know this:  
sometimes something begins against our will,  
but then it becomes something we want.  

For example, a young woman may be forced by her father to marry a man she doesn’t like—she wanted another.  
But after her father insists, it often happens that she learns to love her husband,  
and then lives with him willingly.  

So her first, unwilling step into that marriage  
later becomes truly good and beneficial,  
bringing children and many other blessings.

In the same way here:  
At first, a man may resent being forced away from dice games, adultery, or other sins.  
Later, he will be grateful he was stopped,  
and it will benefit him greatly toward the eternal banquet.

From this you can also answer the third objection:  
“At the beginning, being pushed toward the banquet feels unpleasant;  
how then can it be free and joyful?”

At first, yes, it isn’t pleasant.  
But when a person comes to understand what’s truly at stake,  
it becomes something he chooses freely and gladly.  

You already have an example in the young woman.  

Here’s another:  
A merchant is on a ship loaded with goods.  
The cargo is so heavy it’s pulling the ship down toward sinking.  
Seeing the danger, he throws the goods into the sea rather than drown with them.  

Throwing away his merchandise is, in one sense, unpleasant—he doesn’t *want* to lose it.  
Yet he does it freely,  
because he’d rather lose his goods than his life.  

So the same act can be both forced and free in different ways:  
forced at the beginning,  
free at the end.  

Losing the cargo is in one sense against his will—he’d rather keep it—  
and in another sense according to his will—  
he chooses to throw it away rather than die with it.

So too, being compelled toward the eternal banquet  
is at first unpleasant and against our feeling.  
But in the end it becomes joyful.  

It’s like medicine for the sick.  
When the doctor sews up a wound or cuts a limb,  
it’s very painful;  
but when the patient is well again,  
he’s deeply thankful it was done.

Fourth objection:  
“If we are compelled, where is free will? Isn’t our freedom destroyed?”

I answer:  
The will is *always* free, so that no one except God himself  
can so force it that a person chooses something without wanting it.  

Compulsion can push, frighten, influence,  
so that a person is *more likely* to choose something than without that pressure,  
but it cannot destroy freedom of will.  

So free will stands firm  
even when outward compulsion nudges it toward the good.

---

So you see:  
It *is* right for earthly rulers, by their power,  
to compel the wicked toward good.  

And it’s right for priests,  
not so much by force, but by gentle exhortation,  
to lead people to the banquet.

Christ, in this Scripture, teaches both groups:  
he commands the priest to *call*,  
and the ruler to *compel*.  

He also gives them his own example:  
to priests he teaches humility,  
and to rulers, as King, he shows holy severity—  
driving the money-changers out of the temple with a whip,  
and with a single word knocking down the Jewish crowd who came to seize him,  
and later casting Saul—Saint Paul—down to the ground on the road  
as he rode out to arrest Christ’s servants.

May the same Christ grant that we not refuse his invitation,  
that we not cling to pride, greed, or sexual sin,  
but that, whether called gently or even pushed by discipline,  
we truly come to his great banquet,  
and there rejoice with him forever.
