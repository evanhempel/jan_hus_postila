# Monday After Easter Night

Luke 24:13–35

At that time two of Jesus’ disciples were going to a town about sixty stadia from Jerusalem, called Emmaus. They were talking together about all these things that had happened to Christ in Jerusalem. And as they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and walked with them. But their eyes were kept by God’s power from recognizing him.

He said to them, “What are these words you are exchanging with each other as you walk, and why are you sad?”

One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who doesn’t know what has happened there in these days?”

He said to them, “What things?”

They answered, “About Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, powerful in deed and in word before God and all the people; and how our chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be condemned to death, and crucified him. We were hoping that he was the one who would redeem Israel, freeing our Jewish people from the Gentiles. And now, *super haec omnia et praeter haec omnia*—besides all this—today is the third day since these things happened.

“Some women from our group amazed us. They were at the tomb early this morning, and when they didn’t find his body, they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels—meaning they saw angels—who said that he is alive. Some of our people went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see him.”

Then he said to them, “Foolish men, and slow in heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Didn’t the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?” And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them all the Scriptures that were written about him.

They came near the town where they were going, and he acted as if he were going farther. But they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, because it is getting toward evening, and the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them.

When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight so that they no longer saw him. They said to each other, “Didn’t our hearts burn within us—didn’t they blaze with joy—while he was talking to us on the road and opening the Scriptures to us?”

And they got up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, who were saying, “The Lord has truly risen and has appeared to Peter.” And they told what had happened on the road, and how they recognized him in the breaking of the bread.

This holy reading is clear enough for understanding, and it is long. That is why, in part A, Saint Gregory did not want to explain it all, but very briefly showed how Christ dealt with these disciples: he appeared to them outwardly, to their bodily eyes, in the same way something was happening inwardly before the eyes of their hearts.

They both loved and doubted at the same time. The Lord Jesus was bodily with them; who would say he had not shown himself to them? And because they were talking about him, he was with them. But because they were doubting him, he did not reveal who he was.

He spoke with them, corrected the hardness of their understanding, and opened to them the hidden meaning of the Scriptures about himself. And because, in their hearts, faith in him was like that of a stranger, he acted as if he were going farther—not deceitfully, but he showed himself to them outwardly as he really was in their minds: like a passing traveler.

They needed to be tested, so that those who did not yet love him as God might at least learn to love him as a traveler. And because they could not be without some love for the one who is the Truth walking with them, they invited him into the house as a guest.

But why do we say “invited,” when it is written that they “urged” or “pressed” him? From this we can clearly take an example: travelers—*pútníci*—are not only to be invited, but even drawn and brought into the house.

They prepared a table, brought out food, and the God whom they had not recognized through the explanation of Holy Scripture, they recognized in the breaking of the bread. Hearing God’s commands they were not yet enlightened, but when they did them, they were enlightened.

For it is written (Romans 2:13): “It is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be made righteous.” Therefore, if you want to understand what you hear, hurry to put into practice what you already understand.

See: the Lord is not recognized when he speaks, but he allows himself to be recognized when he is feeding them. So, dearest brothers, love *hospodářstvie*—love hospitality; do deeds of kindness.

For this reason Saint Paul says (Hebrews 13:1–2): “Let brotherly love remain among you; and do not forget hospitality, for through it some have pleased God by receiving angels as guests.” And Peter also says (1 Peter 4:9): “Be hospitable to one another without complaining.”

And the Truth, Christ, says (Matthew 25:40): “Whatever you did for one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.” See: even before the judgment, when he is received in his members, he himself praises and encourages those who receive him. And yet we are lazy when it comes to hospitable love.

Consider, brothers, how great the power of hospitality is: at your tables receive Christ, so that you may be received by him to the eternal feast. Give your guest, Christ, a place in your home, so that on the day of judgment he will not say he never knew you as strangers and travelers, but will receive you as his own into his kingdom.

This is the whole sermon of Saint Gregory on this reading, except for one small example. See how briefly this dear pope preached! But at the beginning he excused himself, saying he wanted to speak only a few things to his hearers, because perhaps fewer things would profit them more; a small amount of food is often received more gladly.

Beyond Gregory’s explanation, a faithful Christian can draw much more that is useful for the soul from this reading. In it is set before us the fourth glorious appearance of Christ on that day.

For, as the Scriptures witness, Christ the Lord showed himself yesterday—on Easter day—five times: first to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:14); second to the women (Matthew 28:9 and Luke); third to Peter, as is mentioned in this reading; fourth to these two disciples; and fifth to all the disciples together, except Thomas (John 20:19).

The sixth time he appeared to all the disciples eight days later (John 20:26). The seventh time, at the Sea of Tiberias, to seven disciples (John 21:1). The eighth time, to the eleven disciples on a mountain in Galilee (Matthew 28:17). The ninth time, to the eleven as they sat in Jerusalem on the day of his ascension (Mark 16:14). The tenth time, on the Mount of Olives, just as he was about to ascend, to them all together (Luke 24:36).

These ten appearances are written for us, showing how he revealed himself from his resurrection until his ascension. And even if he appeared more often, we do not have those written down.

He appeared, this gracious Savior, to comfort the sorrowful. We believe that he visited his dear, sorrowing mother, who did not doubt, and that he also visited others to comfort them. Second, he appeared to strengthen them in faith and to correct their unbelief, as he corrected these two disciples when he said to them:

“Foolish men, and slow in heart to believe!”

And he appeared to teach them, as he does in this reading and in others, proving to them his resurrection, of which this reading says: “The Lord has truly risen.”

Here, then, understand that Christ rose “truly,” “quickly,” and “immortally,” as a lesson for us.

First, he rose truly and certainly, not in a deceptive way, as when the prophet Samuel was supposedly raised at Saul’s request by the witch (1 Samuel 28:14), which was a misleading appearance. In the same kind of misleading “rising” are those who, following the opinion of some old-woman superstition, imagine that they are free from sins just because they confess them, while in their will they do not let go of the sin.

Second, he rose quickly, so that if any of us should die in soul through mortal sin, we would quickly rise from that sin. Opposite to this are all those who lie long in their sins, and by habit already stink like Lazarus in the tomb.

Third, Christ rose perfectly and immortally, so that he will never die again. In the same way, we, when we rise from mortal sins, should not die again. That is how all those rise who, once made alive in soul by God’s power out of mortal sin, do not again commit mortal sin until their death. These have risen with Christ truly, completely, and immortally, and they seek the heavenly things—their dear God, Christ, who rose from the dead in glory, sits at the right hand of God the Father, and who lovingly spoke with his disciples in this reading, in which there are many good lessons:

First, that Christ has truly risen from the dead.

Second, that it is good to talk about his suffering; he loves to be with those who speak with reverent love about his passion.

Third, that God treats people as they treat him, as Gregory’s sermon has already said, in those words: “their eyes were kept so that they did not recognize him.” For whoever does not know God, God also does not know him—know him, that is, in the sense of grace and salvation—unless he returns again to the knowledge of the Lord his God.

Fourth, that those who do not believe God’s Word ought to be rebuked and corrected. This is in the words where Christ says to them, “Foolish men and slow in heart to believe,” and so on.

Fifth, that everyone must suffer if he wants to be saved. If the Head, Christ, had to suffer and so enter his glory—as he himself says in this reading—how will the members expect to escape suffering?

Sixth, that people who are traveling—*pútníci*—should not only be kindly received, but even urged and pressed to stay. This we see where these disciples “constrained” Christ to stay with them.

Seventh, that worthy receiving of the body of Christ under the form of bread gives a true knowledge of Christ. This is in the words: “He took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him.” Here Saint Augustine says (De conss. evang.) that when he had spoken Scripture to them, he consecrated the bread for them into his body. That is the word of holy Augustine.

Eighth, that the hearts of people who are not hardened are set on fire for good by God’s Word. For these disciples say, “Didn’t our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us and opened the Scriptures?”

These are the useful teachings in this reading. But to be certain which two disciples they were is not necessary; of Cleopas we are sure, of the other we are not. And whether Emmaus was a fortified town, a small city, or a village—what profit is there in arguing that? It is more likely to have been a town, for Christ even called Jerusalem a *hrádek*—a small walled town.

These disciples, because they did not believe the women and Peter when, in Jerusalem, they told them that Christ had risen from the dead, were wavering in their faith. That is why the reading says that on the road “they were talking together and debating with each other.”

In these two things they are not to be imitated: we must not doubt Christ’s resurrection, and we must not entertain ourselves with empty talk. For Christ says (Matthew 12:36) that people will give account on the day of judgment for every careless word. And Saint Gregory says that a careless word is one that neither brings any benefit nor is truly necessary to a person.

Therefore we must put a door on our lips and speak the words of God, as Saint Peter says (1 Peter 4:11): “If anyone speaks, let him speak as the words of God.” So when these two disciples spoke about Christ and left off empty chatter, Christ drew near to them, but he appeared to them in a hidden way. And because he wanted to strengthen them in good conversation so that they would not turn away from it, he asked them what words they were speaking with each other. Then, after giving them grace to listen, he taught them the faith.

And again, they, being grateful, asked him to stay with them, even though they did not yet know who he was. “And he acted as if he would go farther,” and did so without sin. In this he taught us not to rush after bodily rewards for our teaching, but to wait for our reward from the Lord Jesus Christ.
