This is a summary of Jan Hus's Easter sermon based on Mark 16:1-7, focusing on Christ's resurrection and its significance for believers. The full text explores the events of Easter morning, the women at the tomb, and the theological implications of resurrection.

- **Key Events**:
  1. Three women (Mary Magdalene, Mary mother of James, and Salome) bring spices to anoint Jesus' body.
  2. They find the stone rolled away and encounter an angel who announces Christ's resurrection.
  3. The angel instructs them to tell the disciples, especially Peter, that Jesus will meet them in Galilee.

- **Theological Themes**:
  - Christ's resurrection proves the promise of eternal life for believers.
  - Hus emphasizes that Christ's resurrection was not solitary—others were also raised (Matthew 27:52), confirming the hope of bodily resurrection.
  - The women's role highlights God's grace to repentant sinners and the importance of faithful witness.

- **Practical Applications**:
  - Believers should endure suffering like Christ, not seeking escape from their "cross."
  - The resurrection assures victory over death and future glorification for the faithful.

> **Key Quote**:  
> "Nerodte sě báti! Ježíše hledáte Nazaretského, ukřižovaného: vstali jest z mrtvých."  
> *("Do not be afraid! You seek Jesus of Nazareth, the crucified: He has risen from the dead.")*
