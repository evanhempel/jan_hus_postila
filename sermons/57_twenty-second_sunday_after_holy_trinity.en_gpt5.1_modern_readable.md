# Twenty-Second Sunday After Holy Trinity

It is written by Saint Matthew, chapter 18, verses 23–35.

At that time our merciful Savior told this parable:

“The kingdom of heaven is like a man, a king, who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. When he began to settle, one servant was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. And because he did not have anything to pay it back, his lord ordered that he be sold, with his wife and his children and everything he had, so that payment could be made. 

Then that servant fell down before him and begged him, saying, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay you everything.’ The lord of that servant had pity on him, released him, and forgave him the debt.

But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. He grabbed him by the throat and said, ‘Pay back what you owe!’ So his fellow servant fell down and begged him, saying, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.’ But he refused. Instead he went and threw him into prison until he should pay the debt.

When the other servants saw what had happened, they were very upset. They went and told their lord everything that had taken place. Then his lord called him in and said to him, ‘Wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me to. Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?’ And his lord was angry, and handed him over to the torturers until he should pay all that was owed.

So also my heavenly Father will do to you, if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts.”

Our merciful Savior has given us this whole reading for one main purpose: that we would be merciful to our neighbors, and especially that we would forgive them from the heart when they wrong us.

To preach this faithfully, we must notice in this reading:

1. Christ’s *power* – He is the mighty King who can avenge.
2. His *wisdom* – He chooses to settle accounts with His servants.
3. His *justice* – He orders that the servant who cannot pay be sold with wife and children.
4. His *mercy* – He releases the servant and forgives the debt.
5. His *just but terrifying punishment* – He gives the merciless servant over to the tormentors.
6. Our *danger* – that the same may happen to us, for Christ says: “So my heavenly Father will do to you, if you do not each forgive your brother from your hearts.”

Jesus says: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man, a king.” That is, the holy church in Christ is like a man who is a king. Christ, who is the Head of the kingdom of heaven – that is, of the human assembly of the saved – deals with His servants in settling accounts in the same way that a wise earthly king would sit in judgment, carefully hear the accounts of his servants, and act as this reading describes.

He is “a man, a king, who wanted” – from eternity, as God – “to settle accounts” with His servants. That means, to examine and test the deserts and earnings of each servant. To “settle accounts” is to reckon up everything a person has received and everything he has spent. So God, Christ the King, has already willed that all our deeds be put into the account and on the scales. He wants to settle accounts with His servants.

And He does this with each servant in two main moments: first, at the servant’s death; second, on the last day, at the final judgment, together with all people.

“When he began to settle accounts” means: when He began to test what each had deserved. And understand this: God begins to “settle accounts” with a person when He begins to show that person what his deeds are really worth – whether they are worthy or unworthy.

How careful a person would be if he truly knew he must give an account to the king of this world, and expected every hour to be called before that king – powerful, wise, and just! How much more careful he should be to give a good account before the all‑wise King, before whom nothing can be hidden, of everything he has ever received from Him!

Therefore Saint Bernard says: Sit down and count what each day might weigh against you, being certain that before God not one good work goes without reward. Just as not one hair from your head perishes unnoticed, so not even the smallest fragment of time will be without either reward or retribution.

We must understand the same about God’s vengeance. For the Savior says in Matthew 12:36: “People will give an account on the day of judgment for every idle word they speak.” An idle word, as the interpreters say, is a useless word – a word that brings or even intends no worthy good. How, then, will people give account for every filthy word, forbidden word, slanderous word, lying word, treacherous word, and angry word they have spoken?

---

The reading continues: “When he began to settle accounts, a man was brought to him.” Saint Augustine asks: Who is there who is not a debtor to God? Only the one in whom no sin at all can be found. So every human being is Christ’s debtor.

But this *one* servant in the parable – the one who showed no mercy to his fellow servant and was handed over to the tormentors until he paid it all – represents the whole company of the damned, just as the man at the wedding feast without a wedding garment, who was bound and cast into outer darkness, represents them.

The reading says he “owed ten thousand talents.” In Latin the word is *talentum* – the largest unit of money, different in value in different lands. In Czech I could not find a better word than “hřivna” for *talentum*, and even that changes from place to place. But spiritually: The one who owes Christ ten thousand talents is anyone who, by not keeping Christ’s serious command, has become worthy of damnation.

We must learn to weigh guilt before God more heavily than guilt before our neighbor, just as a debt of ten thousand talents is far greater than a debt of a hundred coins.

“And because he did not have anything with which to pay” – that is, by his own power he could not make good on his debt or repay it. For this is how it is: A man, by himself, can fall into sin. But without God’s help he cannot rise out of sin, nor make satisfaction for it. Christ says in John 6:44: “No one can come to me unless my Father draws him.”

So “his lord ordered that he be sold.” Saint Jerome says: To be sold means to become the servant of evil spirits. So when the king “orders him to be sold,” the explanation is this: By a just judgment the king has declared that the man will be left to be a servant of evil spirits. For everyone who does not keep God’s commandment – and especially the one who dies condemned – is a servant of evil spirits.

Saint John says in his first epistle, 1 John 3:8: “Whoever sins” – that is, with mortal sin – “is of the devil,” that is, he is born of him, a child of evil. So Christ said to the priests and scribes in John 8:44: “You are of your father the devil.” And again in John 8:34: “Whoever sins is a slave of sin.” Why? Because he has been overcome by sin, and thus by the devil. And Saint Peter says in 2 Peter 2:19: “Whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved.”

So Saint Augustine rightly says: The sinner has as many masters among the devils as he has mortal sins. And you must understand: By sin a man delivers himself to the devil – first in his soul, then in his body. First the devil rules the soul, then the body; so he takes the soul to hell before the body.

The reading continues: “He ordered that his wife and children also be sold, and everything he had.” The “wife” here means evil desire, which conceives and gives birth to evil deeds. The “children” mean those evil deeds themselves. He will be handed over together with them to the devils. And “everything he had” means this: the condemned man has nothing at all that can truly comfort him. Any person in mortal sin, while he remains in that state, has nothing that is truly his in a righteous way, nothing that counts as merit for salvation. But when, through repentance, he is brought back into God’s grace, then everything is restored to him, so that he may again possess it rightly.

The lord “ordered that payment be made” – that is, that full satisfaction be made for the debt, or else that he be handed over to the tormentors forever.

Understand this: Every person owes God back both soul and body, to be used according to God’s will. So if a person is to give himself fully back to God, he must return to Him:

1. **Obedience** in His commandments – and these commandments are what the ten thousand talents signify.
2. **Honor in holy things** – such as in baptism, in receiving the body of the Lord, and in hearing the Word.
3. **Restitution for unjust gain** – for example, the profit taken by usury and unfair dealing.
4. **Satisfaction for transgression** – doing what lies in his power to repair the wrong.

I have written more about this “repayment” and giving of account in the sermon for the Ninth Sunday after Trinity, on the words: “Give an account of your stewardship.”

The parable continues: “Then that servant fell down and begged him, saying, ‘Be patient with me, and I will repay you everything.’”

“Be patient with me” means: Leave me in peace a little longer; bear with me. “And I will repay you everything” means: I will repent, and so I will give back to you everything – my soul, my body, and the fulfilling of your commandments.

See how this servant leads his lord toward mercy. First, he shows **humility**: he “fell down.” Second, he makes **supplication**: he “begged.” Third, he declares his **intent to make satisfaction**: “I will repay you everything.”

These three things – humility, prayer, and satisfaction (together with persevering to the end) – free a person before God from eternal condemnation. This evil servant began well, but he ended badly, because he refused to show mercy to his neighbor.

The reading goes on: “The lord of that servant had compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.” He had compassion, because He is a merciful Lord, ready to show grace to anyone who rightly seeks it from Him. It is His special nature to have compassion and to forgive.

Saint Gregory says: Every sinner should have great hope and comfort, if he wants to leave his sin and be truly sorry, and if he is willing to forgive his neighbor who has offended him. For the reading says: “He released him, and forgave him the debt.” Saint John Chrysostom comments: Look at the mercy of God! The servant asked only for a delay, and he received the complete forgiveness of all his sins.

“But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants.” We are *all* fellow servants, because together we all serve one Lord. So the angel said to Saint John in Revelation 22:9, when John wanted to kneel before him: “See that you do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers.”

This fellow servant “owed him a hundred denarii” – that is, he owed him only a little. For guilt against a human being is much smaller than guilt against God. Notice: earlier the debt was measured in “talents,” here in “denarii”; before it was ten thousand, here a hundred. So both in weight and in number the servant’s debt to his king far exceeds the fellow servant’s debt to him.

“He grabbed him by the throat” – *strangulabat* – that is, he seized his neck and choked him, saying: “Pay what you owe.” A person “grabs his fellow servant by the throat” when he throws him into prison, or tortures him, or shames him, or curses him, or otherwise oppresses him – even though the man cannot pay, or cannot pay without great harm.

Christ very carefully says: “He was *holding him by the throat*.” Saint Augustine explains: To “hold” someone like this means to cherish a desire for revenge against him. This is what Christ points to at the end of the reading when He says: “If you do not forgive your brother from your hearts.” That “holding” is the inner desire for evil revenge; the “strangling” is every kind of outward oppression of a neighbor who truly cannot pay, or cannot pay without heavy damage.

In this “strangling” many sin greatly – priests, monks, and laypeople – when they press and oppress various people for payments, for tithes, or for other debts, and sometimes when there is no real fault at all.

Alas, poor merciless ones! Saint James 2:13 says: “Judgment will be without mercy for the one who has shown no mercy.” That is why in the parable the lord “handed the wicked, merciless servant over to the tormentors.”

So it will go hard with robbers and harsh lords and rulers, but especially with priests who choke and squeeze the poor because they cannot pay tithes – and even more when they torment them to make them give from holy things!

Where then is what Christ says to every priest in Luke 6:29–30? “If someone strikes you on one cheek, offer him the other also. If someone takes your cloak, do not refuse him your tunic. Give to everyone who asks you, and from the one who takes what is yours, do not demand it back.”

And in Matthew 5:40: “If anyone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.”

When will the priests fulfill this word, which, as Saint Augustine says, is especially their command? Instead, they do the opposite. For a single harsh word they drag people to Rome, or elsewhere; they chase after excommunications – also against Christ’s command, who says in Luke 6:27–28: “To you who hear, I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.”

O merciful Savior! You yourself did this, and so did Your apostles. But Antichrist and his followers do the opposite. The evil spirit has set it up for them that they must destroy their enemies – not only open enemies, but even their faithful friends who desire their salvation and want them to fulfill what You commanded. These they choke, drive, sue, curse, slander, and persecute, being the deputies and stand‑ins of that evil servant who grabbed his fellow servant and choked him.

The parable continues: “His fellow servant fell down and begged him, saying, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay you back everything.’” He did exactly what the first servant had done before the king: he showed humility by falling down; he prayed by begging; he expressed his desire to repay, if he were able. But the wicked servant, forgetting the mercy he had just received from his lord, would not listen.

So Christ says: “He was unwilling.” He would not bear with him. O evil man! You would not understand what it is to do good. Your own plea for mercy was still warm in your throat. You had just now been mercifully released from all your debt – and already you refuse to show mercy for a little while. It will go badly for you!

About you Christ says: “He was unwilling, and went and threw him into prison until he should pay the debt.” Truly, this servant is cruel. And there are even more cruel people: those who, without any guilt proven, throw others into prison, into stocks, into chains, and into harsh confinement.

“When the other servants saw what had happened” – that is, when they saw the fellow servant’s humility, his plea, and his will to pay, and then saw this man’s ingratitude and cruelty – “they were greatly distressed.” These “servants” or “fellow servants” are the angels and the saints. When they see the cruelty of a wicked person, they do not like it, and they are grieved by it.

“And they went and told their lord everything that had happened.” They “went,” that is, by their inner desire. They “told,” not as if the Lord did not know, but in the sense that they long for just punishment to fall on the wicked servant, and they ask for help and comfort for the one being choked and oppressed, that he might patiently endure.

“Then his lord called him.” Christ speaks as if it had already happened, so that we may be certain: every merciless person will be called by the Lord. This calling should already be happening now in our hearts; later it will come at our death; and finally at the last judgment.

He said to him: “You wicked servant!” He calls him wicked because he received mercy from his lord but then dealt mercilessly with his neighbor. So he was both unjust, and evil, and malicious.

“I forgave you all that debt because you begged me. Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?” The wicked servant has nothing to answer. Truth itself has shut his mouth. Just like the man without the wedding garment, to whom the king said: “Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?” – and he was speechless.

So we see: for every merciless person, after death all excuses will end.

“His lord was angry and handed him over to the tormentors until he should pay all that was owed.” “He was angry” means: he weighed this evil very seriously. He “handed him over to the tormentors,” that is, to the devils, who are God’s officers and executioners over the wicked by God’s power.

They are to torment him “until he has paid it all.” And because the wicked servant never repays his debt after death, he must therefore be tormented forever.

Here you have the answer when someone asks: Why does God punish a person forever? The answer is: Because that person never repays the debt and never lets go of his evil. Just as the wicked man never turns from his malice for all eternity, so the just Lord never releases him from his torments for all eternity.

“So also my heavenly Father will do to you, if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts.”

Christ has told the whole parable for this purpose: to show that the heavenly Lord will hand over to the devils anyone who refuses to forgive his neighbor from his heart, and they will torment him forever.

So, closing the reading, the Savior says: “So my heavenly Father will do to you” – that is, He will give you over to the tormentors, “and you will not get out until you have paid the last penny” – “if you do not forgive each your brother from your hearts.”

Let us weigh these words carefully. Let us not hold bitter anger in our hearts against our neighbor.

Let us forgive, first, **because God wills it**. He died on the cross in order to forgive His debtors and to buy them back from the tormentors.

Let us forgive, second, **for our own good**. If we forgive a little, God will forgive us much – indeed, the whole debt, however great it is. As the Lord says in this reading: “I forgave you all that debt.”

Let us forgive, third, **because of the terrible punishment** we want to avoid, which Christ now mentions when He says: “So my heavenly Father will do to you” – that is, He will hand you over to the tormentors forever – “if you do not forgive your brother from your hearts.”

Our merciful Savior values this forgiveness so highly that He placed it in His own prayer, which He gave us and commanded us to pray. He says in Matthew 6:9: “Pray like this: Our Father…” And then in Matthew 6:12: “Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.”

And He adds in Matthew 6:14–15: “If you forgive people their sins, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive people, your Father will not forgive your sins.”

O angry and bitter person, how can you not value this both comforting and frightening word of your Savior? How can you not understand that your evil anger harms you more than a sharp sword in your heart, more than a snake or a scorpion at your breast, more than a live coal in your lap?

Saint John Chrysostom says: If you hate your enemy, you harm your own soul more than you harm his body. You may not hurt him at all by hating him, but you certainly harm yourself without fail. Therefore, if you forgive your enemy, you have forgiven yourself even more. If you do good to him, you have done more good to yourself than to him.

These are truly golden words.

So then, as Christ has commanded us to forgive our brothers mercifully from the heart, not only with the lips, let us do it – so that He may forgive us our sins and give us eternal life.

Amen.
