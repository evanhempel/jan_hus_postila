# Readings For Palm Sunday

The holy Matthew writes in chapter 21, verses 1–9:  
“When Jesus was drawing near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, he sent two disciples…” and so on.

Today, faithful Christians remember what our gracious Lord, the Lord of all the world, did, as today’s holy Gospel shows. I already explained this reading on the first Sunday of Advent; now I want to turn straight to what Jesus did.

Let me remind every faithful soul: our merciful Savior, for our salvation, draws near to Jerusalem today, and in doing so he shows you three things—great humility, great mercy, and true justice.

He shows his humility by this: that he, the Lord and King of the whole world, rides in simply on a little donkey, to shame the pride of this world.

He shows his mercy by this: that as he rides toward Jerusalem, knowing exactly what is going to happen to his people—both to their bodies and to their souls—he weeps loudly over them. He sobs so hard that he cannot even finish his sentence, saying, as it is written in Luke 19:42: “Jerusalem, Jerusalem! If only you knew, even you, this day…” And then, overcome by tears, he breaks off and weeps.

He shows mercy again in the temple when the blind and the lame come to him, and he heals them.

And he shows justice when he drives the priests and the merchants out of the temple with a whip, saying to them, as Matthew 21:13 records: “It is written: ‘My house is to be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers.’”

So today you see in your Savior humility, mercy, and justice—so that you, knowing this, will yourself be humble, merciful, and just today.

My dear friend, marvel today at his great humility: that the eternal God, the Creator of all things, the King of angels, for our salvation walked everywhere on foot—tired, worn out—through towns, through villages, through deserts. Only once, as today, did he ride, in order to fulfill the prophecy of the holy Zechariah, who says in chapter 9, verse 9: “Look, your king is coming to you, righteous and bringing salvation; he is poor and riding on a she‑donkey and on a young donkey.”

He says, “your king”—be amazed that your king comes to you for your redemption. “Righteous”—so that he will never wrong you. “Bringing salvation”—so that he will save you, not destroy you, if you will be good. “He is poor”—for your sake, so that you may be eternally rich. “Riding on a young donkey”—to show humility, and to give an example that earthly lords and church leaders may ride when there is need, but always beware of pride. Therefore he rides on a donkey, without a saddle, in all simplicity.

Who can ponder this in his heart and not be amazed, that the Lord of all the world, and a man so physically large and strong, who had never ridden before, chose to ride a little donkey?

Saint John Chrysostom says: “The Lord did not sit on a golden chariot, glittering in rich cloth of gold. He did not mount a spirited warhorse, but a quiet little donkey.”

And do not be troubled that Scripture sometimes says he sat on a she‑donkey and sometimes on a colt. He sat on both, just as the prophet Zechariah says that he sat on a she‑donkey and on a colt, and Matthew says the same in today’s Gospel. This is not for nothing, but to show that both the old sinner and the young one, when they surrender to him, belong to him: the old by the she‑donkey, the young by the colt.

So he comes today in deep humility. Of this humility it is written in the prayer that the priest is to say when, on this day, he goes in procession into the church:

“The One who sits upon the cherubim, whose throne is a pillar of cloud, was riding on a tiny four‑footed animal; he did not bind it with golden bits in a foaming bridle, nor did any sparkling stone shine beneath a hanging canopy, nor glittering threads with tassels dyed in blood‑red, in which worldly pride delights and worldly luxury swells; but the heavenly Lord, sitting in a poor garment on a donkey, was riding in the dust, to teach us by such good examples his own humility.”

That is the very text which, word for word, the pope, the bishop, and the parish priest are supposed to read today as they stand with the procession at the church door—that is, in the ordered line of schoolboys and other people.

And I do not know how the pope could ever read it properly—even if he could read—for many popes, archbishops, cardinals, bishops, canons, and parish priests cannot even read their books. How could he read it, when every word of it condemns him?

Christ on a donkey—and the pope on a great white horse or stallion, with a bridle covered with gold, with precious stones on the bridle, on the breast‑straps, and on the saddle; with long, colored tassels hanging from the saddlecloth almost to the ground; with a cloth covering the horse that drags on the earth. Before him they drive a she‑donkey or a mule, carrying the body of the Lord, eating grass along the way, and they pay no attention to Christ on that animal; but before the pope they kneel. Over his head they carry a canopy like a little heaven and call him “most holy,” pressing forward to beg for benefices, kissing his feet—if his armored servants, with their silver‑tipped staffs, will let them near, for they beat the poor away from his feet.

And he, sitting on his stallion, laughs, pleased that he is praised so highly—while our dear, gentle, humble Savior rides in great tears on a donkey!

So, faithful Christian, weigh this in your mind: when the pope rides like that, is he following his Savior? If you say he is, you deceive yourself. You also deceive yourself if you think it ought to be that way, and if you believe that such a riding pope is “the most holy father.”

Those are deceived too who approve and confirm this for him—cardinals who ride with him in the same pride, the only difference being that each does not have a canopy over his head and quite so much gold on his harness. But they do not walk on foot like the apostles beside the donkey that carries Christ before the pope.

And those are deceived who kneel before him as he rides like that, and all who think this is good. I thought the same way myself until I came to understand the Scriptures and the life of my Savior better. Now, by God’s gift, I know that this is true blasphemy against Christ; it rejects his Word and his example, and it is genuine antichrist‑behavior.

So tell me: how can such men in humility, in tears, in gentleness, and in true devotion remember today the humility, gentleness, and weeping of their Savior, when by their actions they are so utterly opposed to him? How can they read today’s Gospel? How can they honestly say that prayer we heard, which shames all their pride? How can they read the Passion, the story of their Savior’s suffering?

Very unworthily indeed!

Where did they find an example for such pride? In which book of God did they discover it? Surely it is born of Antichrist’s invention, not of Christ, who did everything the opposite way.

We read that when the emperor Heraclius had won back the Cross on which Christ died—having defeated the pagans—he rode proudly toward Jerusalem. And as he neared the gate, the city walls sank down before him and his army. He stopped, afraid, and then saw an angel on the gate, who said to him:

“Heraclius, your Savior, the King of all the world, did not go to his death like this, but humbly, on a donkey.”

Then the emperor understood. He climbed down from his horse, took the Cross on his own shoulder, and walked humbly on foot, humbling himself before God. Only then did the gates open to him.

If such a thing happened to a secular emperor, who did not ride nearly as proudly as the pope does, at the earthly Jerusalem—what do you think will happen to the pope, when the gates of the heavenly Jerusalem, the kingdom of heaven itself, are shut against him? And the same for cardinals, archbishops, and other proud prelates!

Therefore, so that this does not happen to us, let us follow the humble Jesus, who today rides humbly on a donkey, in a humble garment, and with great weeping.

Saint Bernard says: he rode not in wagons, not on horses with golden or silver bridles, not on gilded saddles, but humble, sitting on a donkey’s back, on the simple cloaks of his disciples, which were not expensive.

But why did he want such a procession and honor, knowing that his suffering would follow so quickly? Perhaps to make his suffering even more bitter to him—that such great honor would be followed so soon by such terrible pain. For from this same people, in this same city, and after so short a time, he who had been received with such great praise was shamefully crucified.

How unlike are the cries: “Take him away! Crucify him!” and: “Blessed is he who came in the name of God! Save us in the highest!”  
How unlike the shout: “The King of Israel!” and: “We have no king but Caesar!”  
How unlike the branches of trees and the wood of the cross, the flowers and the thorns!  
They laid their garments before the donkey that carried him in, and soon after they stripped off his own garment and cast lots for it.  
How unlike “Save us!” and “Let him save himself!”

O merciful Savior, why was it necessary—for our sins—that you endure such a cruel, bitter, shameful death?

And what does it mean that right after the procession, in the Mass, we read the Passion, that is, the story of his suffering? It is a strange combination: first the praise of the procession, and then his suffering, which happened on the Friday.

Surely the holy fathers arranged this beautifully so that we would never put our comfort or our hope in any earthly joy—knowing that after joy comes weeping. As a sign of this, our gracious Savior wept in the very midst of his praise, so that we, remembering this, when we experience any success in this world, any honor or promotion, would also remember the sorrow that may follow. And likewise, when we suffer here for Christ’s sake, we should remember the eternal joy.

For this mixture of joy and sorrow is found both among worldly people and among the clergy.

Who then will dare to presume that after worldly joy he will come to eternal joy without any sorrow, when the Lord of angels, who had no sin, after such praise endured such disgrace and torment, even unto death? This is strong proof of how quickly worldly praise passes away.

Let us also notice how people related to the Lord Jesus in different ways that day.

The disciples, according to his command, went and untied the colt and the donkey and brought them to him. They laid their cloaks on them, set the Savior upon them, and walked beside him.

Some of the crowds went ahead of him: they cut branches from the trees and palm branches and flowers, and strewn them in front of him, and spread their cloaks on the road.

The other crowds came behind him. And both groups cried out together in Hebrew: “Osanna!” that is: “Oh, we beg you, save us through the Son of David! Blessed is he who has come in the name of God!”

Saint Luke says in chapter 19, verses 37–38, that as he was drawing near, already on the way down the Mount of Olives, all the crowds of disciples began joyfully to praise God with loud voices for all the mighty works they had seen, saying: “Blessed is the king who has come in the name of God! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!”

But when they praised Christ as God and King, Luke 19:39–40 tells us that some of the teachers of the law from the crowd said to him: “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.” And he answered them: “I tell you truly, if these are silent, the stones will cry out.”

Let us learn from these people and their deeds.

First, from the apostles: let us do what Jesus has commanded us—especially we priests, who have been sent into the “little town” of this world, surrounded by a wall and a moat. The wall is the cruelty of Antichrist; the moat is his deep cunning. This is the fortress of the wicked of this world, raised up against the disciples of Jesus who praise God’s law.

And there, in that world, they immediately find a tied‑up donkey, forced into heavy work. This she‑donkey is the human soul, weighed down with mortal sins, enslaved to the devil’s service, tied by evil desire to the manger of bodily pleasure, with her colt at her side—that is, the human will. This colt is born of a twisted mind, and the she‑donkey feeds on husks: empty, useless vanities.

It is fitting that such a brutish person—and thus his soul—is compared to a donkey or a mule, a stupid animal of burden. The person living in mortal sin is brutish, for just as an animal does not blush before God for what it does, neither does he. And as an animal does whatever its bodily instincts drive it to do, so the sinner, as if he had no reason, runs after bodily desires, using no understanding at all.

Therefore the wise men say—and especially Saint Boethius—that through their foolishness people have lost their true nature.

Understand it this way: by his spirit a person is united with God and with the angels; in spirit he has reason, by which he knows good and evil, and by this he surpasses all *animalia*—all living, sensing creatures: fish, birds, beasts, dogs, and all other creatures with senses. None of these has reason like a human being.

Yet by his body, which is physical and mortal, a person is like all other animals.

Therefore, as long as a person truly uses his reason, he is above the beasts in dignity and is like God and the angels. But when he sets aside reason and follows bodily desire and sins mortally, then by his sin he is cast below the beasts—for he becomes evil, opposed to God, sinful; but the dumb animal is not evil in that way.

That is why Scripture so often says that the sinner is “nothing.” As Saint Paul says in 1 Corinthians 13:2: “If I do not have love, I am nothing.” And David says to God in Psalm 59:9: “You turn sinners into nothing.”

Understand that this way: whoever is in mortal sin is nothing in the grace of God. He does not love God, and God has withdrawn his grace from him, so that nothing he does is precious in God’s holy grace. And if he dies in mortal sin, then forever he will be “nothing” in grace. That is what David means: “You turn sinners into nothing.”

If a person were afraid of physical death, fearing to be turned into nothing so that he would simply cease to exist—as some pagans and heretics wrongly believe—how much more ought he to fear mortal sin, which makes him “nothing” in God’s grace!

And if you would shudder at the thought of being turned into a pig that eats its own filth, you should tremble far more at the thought of dying in mortal sin and being utterly ruined in God’s grace.

Therefore the prophet David says in Psalm 32:9: “Do not be like the horse or the mule.”

The horse is a bawling, high‑strung beast, quick to lust; the mule is barren, for neither male nor female mule ever bears young. The whinnying horses of lust are the wanton, overfed adulterers, of whom the Lord God says in Jeremiah 5:7–8: “I have filled them, and they have committed adultery; they crowded into the house of the prostitute; they have become like well‑fed, eager stallions, each neighing for his neighbor’s wife.”

How many such fat, pampered stallions there are—vicars and absentee priests, turned loose from the work of true shepherds—who from sheer fullness and idleness commit adultery and fornication and whisper foul words to other men’s wives! And how many princes, lords, knights, and fat townsmen live in adultery and fornication—mules barren in spiritual fruit! And beyond that, how many are also physically promiscuous, lovers and mistresses without children, living only for pleasure!

May God grant that such people be untied like donkeys from the manger of bodily pleasure.

Yet some will surely resist being untied from their sins, just as men tried to stop the disciples from untying that donkey, saying to them, as Mark 11:5 puts it: “What are you doing, untying that colt?”

The disciples answered just as Jesus had told them.

Saint Bede says that when Jesus says, “And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord has need of them,’” he is spiritually instructing the teachers of the Church—that is, preachers who teach the people—that if anyone resists, if anyone tries to stop them from untying sinful donkeys and bringing them by confession to the Lord, they must not give up preaching. They must keep saying that the Lord needs these people to build up his Church. That is Bede’s teaching.

With that in mind, when they tried—under threat of excommunication—to stop me from preaching, preventing me by their curses from untying donkeys from the manger of fleshly pleasure by holy preaching, I was not willing to stop. I knew that Jesus had ordered his disciples, when people tried to hinder them, to say that the Lord wants to have these sinners.

But today’s opponents are worse than those men then. For those men quickly stopped resisting and let the disciples untie the donkey. But now they never stop—especially since they themselves are that donkey, tied by the devil to the husks of worldly vanity, to feed on them, and to the manger of fleshly pleasures.

Who now will untie them by preaching from their fornication, pride, and greed? If Peter and Andrew themselves, those two disciples who were sent for the donkey, were to come for these people, they would not untie them.

Yet even if preaching does not untie such people from their sins, it will untie the simple, who are signified by the donkey, as Isaiah 1:3 says: “The donkey recognizes the manger of its master, but Israel does not recognize me; my people do not understand.”

The donkey knows its Master’s manger when the simple person receives the Word of God; but Israel does not know God when the priesthood—who ought to know God better than the common people—do not obey God’s commandments.

So right there, God says through Isaiah in 1:2: “I raised children and brought them up, but they have despised me.”

When teachers bring the donkey to Jesus by holy teaching, so that Jesus may sit on it, they lay on it the garments of the apostles—that is, faith, hope, and love; Peter’s zeal; Andrew’s courage; John’s chastity; James the Greater’s humility; Philip’s diligence in doing good; and likewise the other virtues of the other apostles. Jesus sits on that clothing—that is, he dwells in the soul by his grace.

Now you see what the apostles signify: faithful teachers of the people. And the donkey signifies the repentant person, the soul that had been enslaved by great sins, now untied, brought to Jesus, and covered with the garment of virtue.

Those people who went out along Christ’s road, laying their garments before him and praising him, signify all who humbly strip off the “old man,” as Saint Paul says to the Colossians in 3:9—that is, their old sinful habits—and throw them before Christ by confessing that they are sinners.

They cut branches from the olive tree when they begin to do works of mercy toward their neighbors for Christ’s sake—feeding them, clothing them, pulling them out of sin, and teaching them what is good.

They scatter flowers when they give others fragrant examples by their way of life.

They carry palms—which signify victory—when they have overcome the flesh, the world, and the devil, and stand firm.

Those who walked behind Jesus, praising God, signify all who follow Jesus and openly, joyfully confess his power and his virtues.

They praise the Lord God, first because he has delivered them from many sins; second, because he has kept them from many more; third, because he mercifully waited for their conversion; fourth, because he visited their hearts with his grace; fifth, because he received them into the number of his faithful ones; sixth, because he gave them power now to live well and not fall back into sin; seventh, because he granted them greater grace for earning reward; and eighth, because he has strengthened their hope of obtaining eternal joy.

Who today would be so wicked as not to praise such gifts of the merciful God—and that with a loud voice, as they praised him, saying: “Blessed is the King who has come in the name of God, for our redemption, for our salvation, for our great comfort; for there will be peace for us in heaven and glory to God in the highest”?

But when the devil sees such praise, he stirs up scholars, priests, and teachers of the law to turn against those who follow Jesus and praise God, to scold them and silence them. That is, they will try to use the name of Jesus to curse all who go to the preaching at Bethlehem; and all who sing:

“God has risen from the dead by his own power,”

and again all who sing:

“Jesus Christ, gracious priest,  
with the Father and the Spirit one God,”

and again all who sing:

“Visit us, Christ whom we long for,  
Lord of the world, almighty;  
let us know you in our hearts,  
and await you without terror.”

But to such envious opponents the Lord Jesus answers: “I tell you truly, if these are silent, the stones will cry out.” That is: even those who are hard and foolish in understanding will end up praising me, though you try to stop them.

And so the simple gladly praise our merciful Savior, Jesus Christ.
