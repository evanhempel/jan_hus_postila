# Church Consecration Reading

For the consecration of a church this reading is read, from Saint Luke, chapter 30.

At that time, as Jesus was going out, he was passing through Jericho. And look, there was a man named Zacchaeus. He was the chief of the open sinners, and he was rich. He wanted to see Jesus, to know who he was, but he could not because of the crowd, for he was small in stature. So he ran ahead and climbed a fig tree, in order to see him, because he was going to pass that way. When Jesus came to the place, he looked up, saw him, and said to him: “Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, because today I must stay in your house.” So he hurried down and welcomed him with joy. When they saw it, they all complained, saying that he had gone to a sinful man. But Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord: “Look, Lord, I am giving half of my goods to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone of anything, I am paying back fourfold.” Jesus said to him that today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham; for the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.

This holy reading does not belong among the regular Sunday readings, but it is read at the consecration of a church for two reasons.

First, because it speaks of a house in which salvation took place when Jesus entered it. That “house” was Zacchaeus’s household, together with him. And since the gracious Savior can visit a consecrated church with the same grace, giving grace to the people who gather in the church with a desire for spiritual sight, this reading is chosen as a picture for the day of a church’s consecration.

Second, it is read on that day because this reading is about a public sinner, Zacchaeus, to whom the gracious Savior forgave sins. So that public sinners, who are usually many at a church consecration, when they hear this, may desire grace from Jesus—may beg him to have mercy on them as on Zacchaeus, to forgive their sins, keep them from others as he kept Zacchaeus, and give them eternal life. Then they would remember the consecration of the church in a truly profitable way—by being holy.

And that is what people must diligently strive for. The gracious Savior himself shows them this, he who came, as he says himself, to seek and to save what was lost.

In this reading, Saint Luke shows us three things: in Jesus, great mercy; in Zacchaeus, true repentance; and in the others, foolish complaining.

About the Lord Jesus the reading says: “Jesus went out and was passing through Jericho.” Know this: in the Bible, Saint Luke says “entered,” but in the Mass they read “went out.” So understand: Jesus did both—he went into Jericho, and he went out of Jericho.

Saint Luke says “entered” because he is looking at the beginning of the story. Just before this reading he writes, in chapter 18, verse 35, that as Jesus was drawing near to Jericho, he healed a blind man. Then in chapter 19, verse 1, he immediately says: “And having entered, he was passing through Jericho.” That is: once he had gone into Jericho, he went through it.

The one who arranged the reading in the missal, noticing the going out rather than the going in, wrote: “When Jesus went out, he was passing through Jericho,” meaning: when he left Jericho, he passed by and went on toward Jerusalem, as Saint Luke says after this reading (19:11), that he was near Jerusalem.

It seems to me it would have been better to leave it as Saint Luke wrote: “Having entered, he was passing through Jericho.” I do not know who wrote “having gone out.” Perhaps a copyist made a mistake; but Saint Luke did not err when he wrote: “Having entered, Jesus went through Jericho” on the way to Jerusalem.

“And look, a man named Zacchaeus.” By the words “and look,” Saint Luke shows both that Zacchaeus was well-known and that he was very eager to see Jesus.

He was well-known because he was rich, and because he was a public sinner set over others. For the first reason he was worthy of praise; for the second, worthy of punishment and shame. So Saint Luke says: “And look, a man named Zacchaeus.”

He names him because he was worthy of being named: first, for the great desire he had to see Jesus; second, because he quickly turned to repentance; third, because his repentance was real; and fourth, because he was written in Jesus’s book for eternal joy.

“And he was a chief of the public sinners and rich.” Here we see the abundance of Jesus’s mercy: he is not only ready to receive a sinner, but even a sinner over sinners. For a prince over public sinners is the greatest public sinner.

As I wrote earlier in the sermon for the third Sunday after Trinity about public sinners, understand it the same way here: a public sinner is someone who, without caring about shame, sins openly. In that way empty, loose women, gambling-house keepers, Sunday dancers, usurers, open simoniacs, the greedy, and certain traders and merchants are public sinners.

And the “prince” over them is whoever shares in their sin and rules them. So a woman who keeps other women for men—loose girls or prostitutes—is a princess over public female sinners, especially if she herself commits fornication. In German she is called *hofarta*, and in Czech we say: “a whore over the whores.”

Likewise, whoever runs a gambling den or dice-house is a gambler over the gamblers—not because he plays best, but because he is guilty of all the evil and sin that happens in his house of gambling. The same is true of a landlord who knowingly allows fornication or dice-playing in his house.

So I also say about dancing, by which people mock God on Sundays, as Saint Bernard says. Whoever allows this in his house—especially in a monastery of monks, where they should be weeping over their own sins and the sins of others, reading Holy Scripture, and praying devoutly—turns it into a den of thieves and of whores.

Zacchaeus is called a prince over public sinners because he was a ruler over the tax collectors who took tolls and openly stood in it for profit. People no longer call such men public sinners, because by the habit of sin they do not want to admit it is sin—just as they show by their deeds and their words.

Priests dance on Sunday and say it is no sin to dance. And yet, as Saint Augustine says in *lib. de 10 error.*, it would be better for a woman to plow or do other work than to dance on a feast day—especially on Sunday, which God himself commanded to keep holy.

Oh, misery of the people with their feast days! Not days of holiness, but of sinning. Is that how we keep Sunday holy—by playing games, gluttony, dancing, flirting and courting, quarrelling and fighting, drinking all day, and trading?

To keep Sunday or any feast day holy is to abstain from sin, to leave bodily work and worldly busyness aside, to think about God, to serve him, and gladly put all our effort into our own salvation.

This is what God wants from each of us, when he says in the third commandment, Exo. 20, 8, very clearly: “Remember to keep the holy day holy.” Notice: God says “remember.” He does not add that word so clearly to the other commandments, because he knew people would rarely keep this one. And we see with our own eyes that they do not even keep Sunday holy—which was first called the Sabbath and was kept on Saturday.

The wise Lord set apart only one day of the week and commanded it to be kept holy—that is, to cease that day from sin and from bodily work. But people have set up many feast days. And because, having multiplied feast days and banquets, they commit the most sin precisely on them, therefore God says through Isaiah, chapter 3: “My soul has hated your feasts.” And through the prophet Amos, chapter 5, verse 21: “I have hated and rejected your feast days.” And through the prophet Malachi, chapter 2, verse 3: “I will spread on your face the dung of your feast days.”

God will spread the “dung of our feasts” on our face when, on the day of judgment, he shames us in front of all people for not keeping his feasts holy. On that day we will learn what we really did on our feast days. And if we do not repent, woe to us! Our enemies—the devils—will mock us there, as they already mock our feast days now.

As the prophet Jeremiah says in his Lamentations, chapter 1, verse 7: “Her enemies have seen her and mocked at her feast days.” Whom do the devils see but the soul of everyone who sins on feast days? And they mock those feasts.

This is what priests ought to preach to the people, especially at a church’s consecration, where those gather who do not keep feast days holy and openly sin on Sundays—just as Zacchaeus sinned openly, though not yet as greatly as people now sin—of whom the reading says that he was “a chief of public sinners and rich.”

He was greedy in acquiring wealth, and so he was a public sinner; but he was not greedy in holding on to it, for he gave half to the poor. Even that would not have helped him to final salvation if he had not desired to see Jesus. Therefore the reading goes on to praise him: “He wanted to see Jesus, who he was, but could not because of the crowd, because he was small in stature.”

“He wanted”—that is, he earnestly desired, out of devotion—“to see Jesus” with bodily eyes, to see what he was like.

Titus says that a seed of salvation had already been planted in him when he desired to see Jesus. He could have seen him long before, if he had left his open wickedness. For whoever truly desires to see Jesus cannot keep living in evil. We see this in Zacchaeus: when he saw Jesus with a good desire, he immediately left his evil.

The reading continues: “But he could not because of the crowd, because he was small in stature.” He was small in body and a great sinner in soul; and at that time he could not see Jesus usefully because of the crowd.

Know this: many people are hindered by a crowd from seeing Jesus.

First, the crowd of bad company.  
Second, the crowd of bodily cares.  
Third, the crowd of friends.  
Fourth, the crowd of a large household.  
And especially the crowd of many evil priests, who hinder others from seeing and hearing Jesus—just as the priests and scribes hindered people when Jesus preached in the flesh. They even hindered a blind man from calling to Jesus and scolded him for crying out, as Saint Luke says in chapter 18, verse 39.

So whoever is hindered by any “crowd” from seeing Jesus now in grace by the Spirit, and later eternally, spiritually and bodily, must run ahead of that crowd which holds him back. That is what Zacchaeus did, of whom the reading says: “He ran ahead and climbed a fig tree.”

In Latin it says that he climbed a tree, *sycomorus*. That word is taken from Greek; in Greek *sykos* means “fig,” and they call that tree a “foolish fig,” in Latin *ficus fatua*.

Zacchaeus climbed this tree to see Jesus, “for he was going to pass that way”—that is, where the fig tree stood.

Now understand this spiritually. Zacchaeus, small in stature, represents a person who, because of sins, is small before God but great in wickedness above other evildoers. Such a person must earnestly desire to see Jesus. He must run ahead of the crowd that hinders him, because that crowd is the reason he does not see Jesus. And he must take help in seeing from the fig tree, the so‑called “foolish fig,” which signifies the cross on which Christ was crucified.

Anyone who is a sinner and wants to see Jesus must climb that tree by faith, hope, meditation, and imitation. Otherwise a sinner cannot see Jesus now in grace, or later in glory, because sin makes him too small to see.

And on this “foolish fig,” Christ’s cross—meaning his suffering—which is sweet to the penitent but foolishness to lovers of the world—Zacchaeus (whose name can be interpreted “the one who hastens” or “made righteous”) must climb step by step.

The first branch of holy suffering in repentance must be humility.  
The second, sorrow for sin.  
The third, hope in God’s mercy.  
The fourth, desire to see God.  
The fifth, growth in the grace of God.  
The sixth, waiting for the coming of Jesus at death and at judgment, with remembrance of his holy death.

A person who waits for Jesus in this way will see him. And Jesus, looking up at him, will call him to come down from suffering at the right time, just as he called Zacchaeus. The reading continues:

“When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him, ‘Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, because today I must stay in your house.’”

Zacchaeus, the public sinner, wanted to see Jesus. And Jesus, the merciful one and lover of the penitent, wanted to live in Zacchaeus’s house. The reading says: “When Jesus came to the place”—to where the fig tree stood—“he looked up” with his bodily eyes at the one he had seen from eternity with his divine knowledge.

It was good for Zacchaeus to see Jesus; it was even better for him to be seen by Jesus with a merciful gaze. This is the gaze David asks for when he prays in Psalm 25,16 and 86,16: “Look on me and have mercy on me!”

About this look the reading now says: “He looked up, saw him, and said to him”—to one now ready to hear him—“Zacchaeus, hurry and come down.”

The Savior calls the sinner by name so that he may know he is known. He also shows him his kindness by this, that he loves him—as he said to Moses, Exod. 33,17: “You have found grace in my sight, and I have known you by name.”

O merciful Jesus! Zacchaeus wants to see you, and you graciously speak his name and tell him to hurry and come down, giving your reason: “Today I must stay in your house,” that is, remain or be there.

O gracious Jesus! Who forces you so that you say to Zacchaeus, “Today I must be in your house”? Surely it is your great mercy and Zacchaeus’s great desire—that you would be in his physical house today, eat there with your disciples, comfort Zacchaeus, and forgive his sins.

The reading continues: “So he hurried down and welcomed him with joy.”

Here Saint Luke praises the obedience of Zacchaeus, that he carried out Jesus’s command. He says: “He hurried down”—without arguing, and without fearing the priests—“and welcomed him with joy.”

O sinner! Jesus calls every day that we would be ready for him, because he wants to eat with us. He says in Revelation, chapter 3, verse 20: “I stand at the door and knock; if anyone opens to me, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.”

Yet we are worse than Zacchaeus if we do not joyfully receive him into the house of our soul. We are not as obedient as Zacchaeus—once a sinner and now a saint.

“When they saw it, they all complained, saying that he had gone to a sinful man.”

They sinned, judging both Christ and Zacchaeus wrongly: Christ, as if he had acted badly by going into the house of a public sinner; and Zacchaeus, whom they still counted a sinner, although he was now repentant.

O repentant sinners, be comforted that Christ Jesus gladly associates with those who repent and invites himself to them. To the complainers he says in Luke, chapter 5, verses 31–32, when they murmured that he ate with sinners: “Those who are healthy do not need a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”

Since, apart from him, all people are sinners in their own time—for David says, Ps. 13,3: “They have all turned aside; together they have become useless. There is none who does good, not even one”—he came to call all of us to repentance, calling himself our physician.

And he is truly a good and faithful physician: good, because he can heal every disease, bodily and spiritual, except final impenitence; and faithful, because he wrongs no one and heals without payment.

Knowing such a physician, Zacchaeus—sick in soul—stood before him. The reading says further: “But Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord: ‘Look, Lord, I am giving half of my goods to the poor; and if I have cheated anyone of anything, I am paying back fourfold.’”

Understand this: Zacchaeus stood before Jesus, serving him bodily and ready to repent. That is the first good thing. And he spoke to the Lord, recognizing his own sin before him:

“Look, half of my goods, Lord, I am giving to the poor.” In Latin it says *bonorum meorum*, “my good things.” Of those he says, “half I am giving to the poor.”

Here is good teaching for everyone who wants to give alms.

He should give generously, for Zacchaeus says “half.”  
He should give good things, not bad ones, like Cain.  
He should give what is his own, not what belongs to others—unless he has authority to distribute it, or there is great need and some other worthy cause.  
He should give to the needy, as Zacchaeus says: “I am giving to the poor.”  
And he should give for the Lord’s sake, not for his own praise, for he says: “Lord!”—as if he said: “Lord, for your will and for your praise I am giving to the poor.”

“And if I have cheated anyone of anything, I am paying back fourfold.” That is: if I have, in some way, even a little, short-changed or defrauded anyone, “I am paying back four times as much”—in Latin, *quadruplum*.

For example: four good coins, each worth one, are fourfold compared to one coin, though they are not four times more; they exceed the one by three.

Zacchaeus easily remembered that God had commanded in Exodus, chapter 22, verse 1: “If anyone steals one sheep, he must pay back four sheep for one sheep.”

O robbers of the poor, men of violence, usurers, and simoniacs! When will you fulfill that law?

Notice that Zacchaeus does not say, “I will return,” but “I am returning.” When a person can restore what is not his, he must not delay—unless there are other worthy reasons to wait. Saint Augustine says: whoever can restore what belongs to another and does not do so is not truly repenting.

Zacchaeus did not delay restitution, as many delay it until death, and then, half-conscious and speechless, try to order things when no one understands them.

Not so Zacchaeus, who says: “If I have cheated anyone of anything, I am paying back fourfold.” When he says “if I have,” as though he doubted, he shows that he had not cheated many. And because he had a sincere desire, a true confession, and a real restitution—“I am paying back fourfold,” that is, four times as much—

and because whoever truly repents finds Jesus merciful, the reading continues:

“Jesus said to him, ‘Today salvation has come to this house.’”

By these words the Savior comforts Zacchaeus and assures him of forgiveness and salvation. He also rebukes those who complained—both from Zacchaeus’s side and from his own.

From Zacchaeus’s side, when he immediately says: “Because he also is a son of Abraham”—that is, one who follows Abraham toward salvation. From his own side, he rebukes the complainers when he says: “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.”

As if he said: You complain that I went in to Zacchaeus, a public sinner, as if he were evil. Know this: he is, by his following, a son of Abraham; he no longer clings to his wealth, just as Abraham did not. Therefore salvation has already come to him in hope.

And you must not complain about me, that I came to him. I wanted to be the Son of Man and to come into this world precisely for this: to seek by preaching, and to save by giving grace, “what was lost” by sin.

Now you see how the gracious Savior defended both Zacchaeus and himself from their complaining, and gave them useful instruction so that they would not complain.

He says: “Today salvation”—that is, in hope—“has come to this house”—to all the household, and especially to Zacchaeus’s conscience—“because he also is a son of Abraham,” by following him.

Saint Bede says Zacchaeus is called a son of Abraham, not because he came from Abraham’s bloodline, but because he followed his faith. From this some want to conclude that Zacchaeus was not from Abraham’s stock, and so not a Jew, since all Jews were from Abraham’s line. Saint Ambrose also suggests Zacchaeus may have been a Gentile.

We do not need to argue about this. It is enough for us that the One who cannot err says that Zacchaeus is a “son of Abraham”—whether as a son only by following, or as a distant physical descendant who also followed; but especially as a follower, for the Savior values that sonship more than bodily descent.

Therefore he says to the Jewish priests, when they boasted that they were Abraham’s offspring, John 8, 39–40 and 44: “If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham… but you are of your father the devil.”

Zacchaeus was no longer such a son, although earlier, by deadly sin, he had been a son of the devil by following him. Now he is a son of Abraham, enlightened, found, and saved by Christ.

Therefore the Savior says: “For the Son of Man came”—into this world by becoming flesh—“to seek,” that is, to look for by preaching, “and to save” by his grace and redemption.

He came full of truth and grace, in order to find and “save what was lost”—that is, the human being who had lost innocence, God’s grace, and joy by breaking God’s command.

Know this: when the Savior says, “The Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost,” he shows us his divine goodness and his humility.

When he says, “came,” he shows his divine goodness. When he says, “Son of Man,” he shows his humility—for by taking on our humanity he humbled himself, choosing to be a servant among his servants. As he says himself, Matt. 20, 28: “The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”

And when he says, “to seek and to save what was lost,” he shows our misery, our need, and our benefit.

Our misery: that the whole human race was lost by sin—lost in innocence and in grace—and would have been lost forever if the Son of Man had not come, had not sought, and had not saved.  
Our need: that it was necessary for us that he come and seek us.  
Our benefit: that he came and saved us.

He is the gracious Savior, blessed forever. Amen.
