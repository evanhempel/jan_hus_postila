# Fourth Sunday After Holy Trinity

St. Luke, chapter 6, verses 36–42.

At that time Jesus said: Be merciful to your neighbor, just as your Father in heaven is merciful. Do not judge rashly, so that you will not later be judged justly. Do not condemn anyone to damnation, and you will not be condemned to eternal damnation. Forgive guilt mercifully, and you will be released from guilt, and so also from torment. Give earthly things, and it will be given to you—the kingdom of heaven: a good measure from the best things, filled up with no emptiness, pressed down so it does not shift, and running over, so that joy overflows on every side—will be poured into your lap, that is, into your desire. For with the measure you use—whether you act mercifully or not—it will be measured back to you and repaid to you. And he also told them a parable: Can a blind man lead a blind man, that is, can a fool teach a fool? Will they not both fall into a pit—into sin and into damnation—unless they repent? A disciple is not above his master, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his master. And why do you see the speck, that is, some small sin, in your brother’s eye—in his desire or conscience—while you pay no attention to the plank, that is, the great sin, that is in your own eye, in your own conscience? How can you rightly say to your brother: “Brother! Let me take the speck out of your eye”—the little sin out of your conscience—while you yourself do not notice the plank of great sin in your own eye, in your own conscience? Hypocrite—you who cover your own sin—first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye.

Our merciful Savior, as he teaches his followers, leads them to imitate their heavenly Father in mercy. In this way he lifts up both their understanding and their desires, so that by understanding rightly they may set their desires rightly on what is good.

Therefore, the merciful Savior first stirs our desire toward mercy, saying: “Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.” Know this: mercy is a willing heart that wants to help the needy out of their distress. Because God has that will—to help the needy out of their distress—he is called merciful.

And no person in this world can excuse himself by saying he cannot have a will that desires to help the needy out of their distress. For that reason no one can excuse himself from being like his Father, God the merciful. It is true that a person may not be able, as God can, to help whomever he wishes as powerfully as he wishes. So learn to distinguish: God is merciful without measure; we are merciful in a limited way.

Also know: because mercy is a willing heart that wants to help the needy, it is first of all in the soul. But not every merciful act itself is *in* the soul. For example, feeding the hungry is an outward act; but the will that moves a person to give that food is in the soul.

So many are truly merciful, even though they do not actually relieve anyone’s need; they would gladly do so, but they lack the means. To such people the angels proclaimed peace at Christ’s birth, saying (Luke 2:14): Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will!

On this the two holy popes, Gregory and Leo, say in one voice: *Nenie prázdna ruka od daru, když skříně srdcě naplněna jest dobré vóle.* That is their meaning: when a person would gladly give something with his hand to help another out of need, but he has nothing, then his hand is not empty in God’s sight—it is not without a reward.

So learn this: sometimes a person who gives nothing to the poor is more merciful than another who gives much. The first would love to give, and his desire is great, but he has nothing. The second gives from a small desire and from a great surplus. And the Lord does not weigh so much *how much* a person gives, as with *what good will* and with how great a desire he gives.

Therefore our dear Christ, seeing many people putting large sums of money into the temple treasury, and one poor widow who put in two small copper coins, called his disciples and said to them (Mark 12:41–44): Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all the others. For they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, has put in everything she had to live on. From this let us learn to do the good we do from a deep desire, so that the merciful Savior, who says, “Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful,” may praise us.

Now understand further: since mercy is the will to help the needy out of their distress whenever a person is able, we need to see that there are two kinds of distress in a person: distress of the soul and distress of the body.

Distress of the soul is sin, ignorance, and inner sorrow. Distress of the body is thirst, hunger, nakedness, sickness, imprisonment, and lack of rest. Whoever out of a good will, and in a right way, desires to help someone in any of these distresses is a merciful person. And when, having the means, he actually does so in deed, that deed shows that he is merciful.

Know that in Matthew 25:35–36 the Lord Jesus lists six bodily works of mercy. They are these: to feed the hungry, to give drink to the thirsty, to shelter the stranger, to clothe the naked, to visit the sick, and to free the prisoner. For such merciful deeds he promises his own the kingdom of heaven, saying (Matthew 25:34–36): Come, you who are blessed by my Father; receive the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me drink; I was a stranger and you welcomed me; I was naked and you clothed me; I was sick and you visited me; I was in prison and you came to me.

There you have the merciful deeds for which the merciful will receive the kingdom of heaven, while the unmerciful will receive eternal damnation. A seventh bodily work of mercy is to bury the dead, as Saint Tobit did, burying the Jews whom the pagans killed when they were prisoners in Babylon (Tobit 1:20–21).

There are also seven spiritual works of mercy: to teach the ignorant, to give counsel to the doubtful, to rebuke the sinner, to comfort the troubled or sorrowful, to forgive a neighbor’s guilt, to patiently bear wrongs that are done to you, and to pray even for your enemies.

And just as the soul is much better than the body, so the soul’s distress is much worse than the body’s distress. Therefore the seven spiritual works of mercy are much better than the seven bodily works of mercy.

On the first spiritual work—teaching the ignorant—Christ founded his law, both by his own example and by direct command, when he said to his disciples (Matthew 28:19): Teach all nations. All faithful Christians should practice this kind of mercy as they have opportunity, but especially priests. They are to teach the people—not lies, not fables, not useless things—but the word of God, plainly and sincerely for salvation, not for greed.

Bishops and pastors are bound to this teaching under pain of eternal damnation. By their example and by the word of God they must pasture the people whom the Savior has redeemed with his own blood.

This is mercy—of which today’s Gospel especially speaks—when the merciful Savior says, “Be merciful, as your Father is merciful.”

And because true mercy belongs together with right judgment, the Savior immediately forbids rash judging, by which people judge their neighbor wrongly. He says: “Do not judge, so that you will not be judged.”

Here you must know, as Saint Augustine says, that some deeds are obviously evil in themselves—like fornication or filthy speech. When someone sees such deeds in another, he *may and should* judge that the person, knowingly doing such things, is doing evil and is, in that moment, a bad man, because he is openly breaking God’s command.

But other deeds can be done either with sin or without sin—for example, eating, drinking, or speaking. If I see someone eating when others are fasting, I must not immediately judge that he is doing wrong. He may be only now taking his meal, or he may be sick and eating without sin. Likewise, if I see a young man speaking with a young woman, I must not judge that they are speaking of something evil, unless I actually hear evil words or see clear signs of evil.

So when we see actions that can be done with a good intention or with a bad one, we should be more inclined to think they are done rightly. And if our thoughts pull us toward agreeing and insisting that these deeds must be evil, we must refuse that agreement.

Therefore Saint Augustine says: We cannot entirely avoid forming opinions—since we are human—but we must not allow that opinion to become a settled judgment that condemns. Since we must not judge such outward acts, which could be good, how much more must we not judge hearts we cannot see, and deeds we have not witnessed.

The priests in Christ’s time did not keep this command. They counted Christ’s good works as evil works and sinned by their judging. They continued to consider repentant sinners as if they were still unrepentant, as was said in last Sunday’s reading.

In this way the lawyer Simon wrongly judged Mary Magdalene, saying in Luke 7:39 that she was still a sinner. Another lawyer wrongly judged the publican and many others, saying in Luke 18:11: I am not like other people, or even like this public sinner. In this sin of judging most people today walk very commonly. So the Savior says: “Do not judge, so that you will not be judged.”

Judges especially must pay attention here, so that they do not condemn anyone who is innocent, and also so that they judge with mercy when guilt is clear. All of us must be careful not to judge wrongly in anything.

A person judges wrongly when he knows that someone is rich or has enough for his own needs, and yet says that man is poor so that others will give to him. In this sin priests and lawyers are often found. Their barns, cellars, granaries, and cellars for drink may be full, but their greedy desire is a bottomless pit, never full.

Others judge wrongly when they say of a poor person, “He has enough,” just so they themselves will not give to him or so that others will not help him, even though the poor man is in great need.

Christ forbids all such judging when he says: “Do not judge, so that you will not be judged”—do not judge rashly and meddlesomely, so that you will not later be judged by God justly *for* your judging.

Then the Savior goes further and forbids rash *condemning*, saying: “Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned.” That is: do not presumptuously sentence anyone—neither the living nor the dead—to damnation, for that judgment belongs to God. You do not know what God has done with the dead person, nor what he will yet do with a living sinner who is evil now but may soon become good.

Look at Paul: on his way to destroy Christians, he was suddenly converted (Acts 9:1–21). Peter denied Christ with an oath, then immediately went out and wept (Luke 22:62). To Paul Christ said (Acts 9:4): Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? But at Peter Christ looked with mercy (Luke 22:61).

Matthew, a known sinner, sitting at the tax booth, was called (Matthew 9:9). Mary Magdalene, a sinner, came to Jesus, washed his feet with her tears, and out of her sorrow and love was cleansed from her sins (Luke 7:37, 48). Zacchaeus, a sinner above sinners, had the Savior invite himself to his house: Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house (Luke 19:5). The publican went up to the temple with the Pharisee and went home justified (Luke 18:14). The thief hung on the cross, mocking his Savior, and then, after repentance, heard: Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise (Luke 23:43).

We have clear examples, then, that we must not condemn anyone to damnation, even if we see that he is a great sinner. For Saint Augustine says (*In serm de blas.*): As long as a person still lives in this body, we cannot judge him as finally impenitent. We must despair of no one while God’s patience still leads him toward repentance, so that he is not taken from this world as an evil man. For God does not want the death of the wicked but that he turn from his way and live (Ezekiel 33:11). He may be a pagan today—how do you know he will not be a Christian? He may be a Jew today—how do you know he will not tomorrow believe in Christ? He may be a heretic today—how do you know he will not tomorrow hold the common faith? He may be separated from the Church today—how do you know he will not tomorrow come to the common peace?

What do you say, then, when you see people in some sin, and judge them as the most hopeless of all, and yet, before they die, they repent? Listen: Do not judge before the time! All this is from Saint Augustine.

Someone may object: But Saint Paul *does* judge, when he says in Ephesians 5:5 that fornicators, adulterers, and the greedy will not inherit the kingdom of heaven; is he not condemning them?

Understand this: whenever Paul—or any other Scripture—says that sinners of any kind will not be saved, the meaning is always: *if they do not repent*. So when you see someone fornicating or committing any mortal sin, you may judge and say to him: “You will be damned *if* you do not repent.” Likewise, you may judge yourself and say: “I have mortal sin in me; I will certainly be damned if I do not repent.”

But without that condition you must not say of anyone, “This man *will* be damned,” unless God were to reveal it to you. About yourself, you should always hope that you will repent and be saved.

So a person must weigh very carefully any act of condemning another, because the Savior forbids it under the threat of his own sentence to eternal fire: “Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned.”

After this the Savior not only commands us not to wrong our neighbor, but even, when our neighbor does us wrong, to forgive him mercifully. He says: “Forgive, and you will be forgiven.”

Some Bibles have: “Forgive, and it will be forgiven to you.” Both thoughts hold together well if we hear it this way: “Forgive”—that is, forgive guilt mercifully—“and you will be released” from your guilt. And again: “Forgive” the guilt of your neighbors “and it will be forgiven you” what you have done.

Then the Savior commands us to give to our neighbors, saying: “Give, and it will be given to you.” Give earthly things mercifully, and the kingdom of heaven will be given to you.

“A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be poured into your lap.” By this picture the Savior shows that the poor who receive alms will give back to the merciful the reward of blessedness. This reward is called a “measure” because it will be given according to what a person has deserved.

It is a *good* measure, because it consists of the best things. It is *full*, because it leaves nothing in the soul empty. It is *pressed down*, because blessedness will be given in such a way that it cannot be poured out of a person or taken away from him. It is *running over*—that is, overflowing—for an immeasurable joy will pour out on every side.

The gracious Savior, wanting to stir even peasants and others who love to receive grain or other goods in a good measure—full, pressed down, and overflowing—uses this example, so that they might be more eager for that eternal reward than for earthly rewards. He speaks of it as being poured into their lap, that is, into their understanding, their desires, and even into their bodies. For blessedness, being a satisfaction without lack for the mind, the will, and the body, will fill the understanding, the memory, the will, and the body, and thus all the senses.

With that measure God will measure and give to the merciful what eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man. And to make us merciful and sure of our reward, the Savior adds: “For with the measure you use”—that is, if you act mercifully—“it will be measured back to you.” That is, mercy will be repaid to you.

So here the “good measure” means a good merciful deed, by which a person measures to others and so receives a merciful reward. But a bad measure means an evil deed, and its repayment is the pain of eternal damnation, or at least temporal suffering.

Let those who are living well take note, and rejoice as they hear from Christ with what measure it will be measured back to them. And let the wicked tremble, as they look for the fearful measure prepared for them. Of this God says in Revelation 18:7, about Babylon—which is the gathering of all the damned: As much as she glorified herself and lived in luxury, give her the same measure of torment and grief.

From this teaching of Christ we learn that as each person lives here, so will it be repaid to him. If he often does much good well, he will receive much joy. But if he lives wickedly, it will go badly for him. Therefore Saint Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5:10: Each one will receive what is due him for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.

Here I could speak at length about dishonest measures and weights in town and country, but that would take too long. Let me say it briefly: God commands in Leviticus 19:35–36: You shall not do any injustice in judgment, in measures of length or weight or quantity. You shall have just scales and just weights, a just measure for grain and liquid. Every judge must know that he must do no injustice; everyone who measures with rule, cord, or yardstick; everyone who weighs, who fills by measure or pours out.

Again God says in Deuteronomy 25:13–14: You shall not have in your bag differing weights, a small and a large. You shall not have in your house differing measures, a large and a small. You shall have a full and just weight, and a full and just measure, that your days may be long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you. All who do such things, who deal unjustly in this way, are an abomination to the Lord—that is, all who measure falsely.

And Solomon says in Proverbs 20:10: Differing weights and differing measures—the Lord detests them both. Whoever does not want to be detestable to God must act rightly and give a true measure. For Christ himself says: “With the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.”

Because people have wandered far from this teaching of Christ—especially because of their leaders, blind priests and prelates, that is, bishops and other elders—just as in Christ’s time common people went astray from his teaching because of their masters, bishops, and lawyers who led them like blind guides, Christ warns his disciples not to be such blind guides. He tells them a parable: “Can a blind man lead a blind man?”—that is, can a fool rightly teach a fool? The answer is: Not safely and without harm. “Will they not both fall into a pit?”—into the pit of sin and of damnation.

It is as if the Savior were saying to his disciples: If you are not formed in yourselves as I command you, and if you do not teach as I teach, then you will be blind guides, and you will lead others into sin and damnation.

Know that a blind guide is not fit for anyone who is blind—whether we speak of bodily blindness or spiritual blindness. Bodily blindness is the lack of sight. Spiritual blindness is the lack of understanding. Both are serious hindrances to a guide.

So it is a ridiculous thing—and worse than ridiculous, it is harmful—to have a blind watchman, a teacher who is ignorant, a leader who limps aside, a prelate who shirks his duty, and a messenger who is mute.

Since the priest set over God’s people is to be a watchman, woe to him if, in his understanding, he is blinded by evil; if he does not go in front of the people by good works; if he limps to the left side, bending toward sin by his desires; if he delays and hinders the people from salvation, being mute and unwilling or unable to teach.

Truly, there are many such blind men today! Therefore Isaiah says (Isaiah 56:10–12): His watchmen—that is, the watchmen of God’s house—are all blind; they all lack knowledge; they are all mute dogs that cannot bark; they dream, they lie down, and they love to slumber. The dogs are greedy; they never have enough. And these shepherds have no understanding. They all turn to their own way, each one to his own gain, from the first to the last. “Come,” they say, “let us get wine, and let us drink our fill of strong drink; and tomorrow will be like today, and much more so.”

All this Isaiah speaks of blind watchmen, leaders, and shepherds. Whoever can understand, let him understand; to explain it fully here would take too long.

You who are leaders of the people, and you who appoint leaders over the people, pay attention. And also those who *want* to be leaders—take care. I am sure that a blind man would not want to be a guard on the city wall under a contract that, if enemies climbed the walls because he failed, he would be hanged. Likewise, no lord would quickly make a blind man his tower watchman. How then can an unfit pupil or priest want to be the watchman of many souls? And how can a lord dare entrust many souls to such a man?

Truly, there is great unbelief toward God on both sides—when they so lightly risk the souls of others and their own souls for bodily gain, for praise, or for favor. They do very badly not to fear the pit of eternal damnation, when the Truth himself says: “Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?”—that is, while they walk together in their blindness.

Christ, however, was and is a seeing guide. He is merciful; he did not judge rashly or condemn; he forgave those who wronged him; he gave good teaching, and he fed the people three times: twice with bread and fish, and a third time at the supper of his own body.

So he wants to teach his disciples by his own example and says to them: “A disciple is not above his master.” As if to say: You must do what I command you, so that you will be my followers, I who am your Master, and so that you will be under me as obedient servants, not resisting my commands. Since the Master, who is God, does not take revenge for his own wrongs in a disordered way, the disciples, who are human, must do the same.

For he says (John 13:13–14): You call me Teacher and Lord, and you speak rightly, for so I am. I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you. “The disciple is not above his master”—that is, none of you is above Christ in dignity or in fulfilling the law—“but everyone who is fully trained will be like his master.” As if to say: Every disciple will be complete in goodness if he is merciful like his Master—if he does not judge or condemn rashly, if he forgives guilt, loves his enemies, and does good to those who do him harm.

And whoever does not follow his Master Christ in this is not worthy to rebuke another for sin. He would be a hypocrite, not a true disciple. Therefore Christ, to warn his disciples, says: “Why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye?” That is: Why do you notice a small sin in your brother’s conscience? “But do not notice the plank” of great sin “in your own eye”—that is, in your conscience or in your intention? “How can you say”—that is, how can you rightly say, for his correction—“to your brother,” that is, to any neighbor: “Brother, let me take the speck—this small sin—out of your eye,” that is, out of your conscience or intention, “when you yourself do not notice the plank”—the great sin—“in your own eye,” that is, in your intention? “You hypocrite!”—you who want to appear good before others, while you are secretly evil—“first take the plank out of your own eye,” that is, first remove from yourself the great sin; “and then”—once your own eye is healed—“you will see clearly to remove,” by good teaching, “the speck from your brother’s eye”—that is, the small sin from his conscience or his intention.

In these words of Christ there is much good teaching.

First, that a person has an outer, bodily eye, by which he sees bodily things, and an inner eye, by which he sees non-bodily things—sins, for example, and other things that have no body. This inner eye is sometimes called “understanding,” sometimes “intention.” This is the eye Christ speaks of in his parable, for anyone with sense can see that a *literal* plank cannot fit into a bodily eye, and no one ever had a plank in his eye and then said to another, “Let me take the speck out of your eye.”

Second, Christ teaches us by comparing a small sin to a speck, and a great sin to a plank. For example, a venial sin in the intention is like a speck in the bodily eye. A mortal sin is like a plank: heavier than a venial sin, just as a plank is heavier than a speck. And just as a speck in the eye does not immediately blind it, so venial sin does not immediately destroy a good conscience. But a plank falling on the eye would crush and destroy it; so mortal sin destroys the whole conscience.

Third, Christ teaches that a person cannot rightly rebuke his neighbor for a small sin while he himself knowingly keeps a great sin. Therefore Saint John Chrysostom, speaking on this word, “Why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye,” says: It is as if Christ were saying: It is better not to teach or rebuke a layman at all than to teach and rebuke others while you yourself stand guilty of the same things you rebuke. Such a teacher’s instruction is not fitting but laughable.

So every priest who wants to teach the people must first teach himself. If he is not willing to correct himself and rebuke himself for the very things he would rebuke in others, then let him neither teach nor rebuke.

Fourth, Christ teaches that anyone who tells another to leave sin while he himself knowingly keeps mortal sin is a hypocrite. By his teaching he is covering the sin he has, hiding it from the one he teaches.

So Saint John Chrysostom says: Every teacher who does not first do good and then preach is a hypocrite. For when he teaches good things, he is—by that very teaching—declaring himself before people to be righteous; yet because he acts badly, he is a sinner in himself.

Therefore Christ’s meaning is this: If you want to rebuke a layman freely and truthfully and pull sin out of his mind, then first cleanse your own mind from all evil, so that when you rebuke the layman for his sins, he will not in turn rebuke you for yours. He will fear to do so when he finds in you nothing to despise.

For the seriousness of sin must be weighed according to the person who commits it. If a layman commits a great sin, it is still small—like a speck—compared to a similar sin committed by a priest. But if a teacher, a master, or a preacher commits even a small sin, compared with the layman’s sin it is great and dreadful.

All this is from the golden mouth of Chrysostom.

Therefore those who teach others must carefully avoid sin, especially open and public sin, so that they may freely rebuke others for lesser sins and lead them by Christ’s path like faithful shepherds. Otherwise they are not feeders but devourers, not shepherds but hired hands, not guides but misleaders, not watchmen but the careless, not counselors but traitors and ravenous wolves.

May God grant that we may be merciful, that we may not judge or condemn others rashly, that we may forgive others’ faults and gladly give to the poor; that we ourselves may live well, and from love correct others when they go astray—according to the teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has commanded us to live in this way.
