title: "Addendum: another sermon on reading 46 (Thirteenth Sunday after Holy Trinity)"
---

One man, I trust before God out of a good desire, asked me to write something on these words in Luke 10:30: “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers, who stripped him, and after laying wounds on him, went away, leaving him half-alive.”

Our merciful Savior spoke those words, lifting up His eyes, wanting to teach that lawyer who had asked, “What must I do to inherit the kingdom of heaven?” and to teach us as well, who must do the same things He showed that lawyer. And what did He show? This: that we must love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our mind, with all our strength, and our neighbor as ourselves.

To write fully about that love would take long, and I have already written about it in my book on God’s commandments, in chapter 31. So I will leave that now and instead weigh these words: “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who stripped him, and after laying wounds on him, went away, leaving him half-alive.”

Did this actually happen to some man on the road between Jerusalem and Jericho, between those two cities where pagans now live? I do not know for sure. But in the spiritual sense, this certainly did happen. And because our gracious Savior wanted us to ponder this, He, as Saint Luke says (Luke 10:30), lifted up His eyes and said: “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who stripped him and, after laying wounds on him, went away, leaving him half-alive.”

Merciful Jesus was weighing the misery into which man fell through sin. Leaving Jerusalem—that is, leaving the “vision of peace”—for Jericho—that is, for the changeable, unstable course of this world—there he was robbed, wounded, and left half-alive.

Jesus weighed that. Let us weigh it too. What shall we consider? The departure, the fall, the stripping, the wounding, and the half-death. For when the Lord Jesus lifted His eyes and looked closely, He said: “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers, who stripped him, and after laying wounds on him, went away, leaving him half-alive.”

Let us weigh the departure. How? Like this: Who went? A certain man. From where? From Jerusalem. To where? To Jericho. What happened to him? He fell among robbers, was stripped, wounded, and left half-alive.

“A certain man.” Which man? Adam, with all his sinful offspring. He departed by disobedience from Jerusalem—that is, from the vision of peace and blessedness. Where did he go down? To Jericho—that is, into the instability of this present world.

How did he depart? Listen, for the Savior says he was “going down.” How did this going down happen?

God the Lord created Adam and Eve. He gave them a command not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, saying (Genesis 2:16–17): “You may eat from every tree in the garden, but from the tree that gives knowledge of good and evil you must not eat. For surely, on whatever day you eat from it, you will certainly die.”

Adam and Eve heard that command. They heard the prohibition. They heard the threat of punishment if they did not keep it. And what happened?

Eve saw that tree: pleasant to the eyes, attractive for eating. When she saw it, she desired it. The clever devil noticed this, and taking on the form of a serpent—an animal Eve did not fear at all, for she had no sin—he slithered up to her, found her alone, and said: “Why has God forbidden you to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil?”

Eve answered: “So that we might not die.” The serpent said to her: “You will certainly not die; rather, you will be like gods, knowing good and evil.”

Eve listened to the serpent. She took the fruit, ate it, and gave some to her husband, and he ate. Then the eyes of both of them were opened. They realized they were naked and made girdles for themselves from fig leaves (Genesis 3:1–7).

O, whom did that serpent strip naked? Man. Whom did he wound? Man. Whom did he abandon? Man. Did he leave him fully alive? Not at all. How then? Half-alive.

What death did Adam die? Did what God had said—and wished to prevent—come to pass or not? Surely it came to pass. Adam and Eve died in their souls, even though their bodies remained alive. So they were left half-alive.

Hear, then, the fall from blessedness into this unstable life and into wounding. Notice how man was “going down”; for the Savior says: “A certain man was going down.”

How was he going down? Like this: Eve failed in keeping God’s command, listened to the devil, saw the fruit, desired it, consented, ate, and so broke God’s command.

She began to go down when she yielded to the suggestion. She went further down when she took pleasure in the fruit and in the serpent’s words. And she finished that downward step when she finally consented, disbelieved God who had said (Genesis 2:17), “On the day you eat from it you will certainly die,” and instead said (Genesis 3:3), “So that we might not perhaps die.”

Hearing that doubt, the clever serpent pressed on (Genesis 3:4–5): “You will certainly not die, for God knows that on the day you eat of it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like gods, knowing evil and good.”

See how that “one man was going down”: by suggestion, by delight, by doubting God’s word, by consent, and by the final deed.

Eve accepted the serpent’s suggestion, she doubted God’s word, she agreed with the serpent’s counsel, she wanted to know as much as God. She took the fruit, ate it, and gave some to Adam. Together they completed this going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and passed it on to their sinful offspring.

So that “one man who was going down” represents the whole race of Adam, which walks the same road of sin as Adam did.

Seeing this, the Lord Jesus Christ said: “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers, who stripped him, and after laying wounds on him, went away, leaving him half-alive.”

O foolish man! You trusted the serpent more than you trusted God! What were you lacking? Were you hungry? What did you mean to become—a god?

The angel, that serpent, reached for God’s power in heaven, wanting to be equal with Him. You, man, reached for His wisdom and counsel, wanting to be as wise as God.

What did you gain? That spirit became the devil and is condemned forever, driven out of heaven. And you, man, enslaving your whole race, are driven out of paradise.

O man! You have come down from height to lowliness, from innocence into guilt, from light into darkness, from satisfaction into hunger, from health into sickness, and from life into death. And if there had been no Samaritan, you would have died and been damned forever like the devil.

So Jesus lifted His eyes, saw that your going down, and said: “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers, who stripped him, and after laying wounds on him, went away, leaving him half-alive.”

O man, understand this: going down is evil, the fall is worse, but worst of all is the stripping, the wounding, and the half-death.

The going down is evil: from God’s grace into His anger, from the image of God into the likeness of beasts and of devils. The fall is worse: from peace into unrest, from the company of angels into the company of robber-devils. And the worst is the stripping, wounding, and death: stripped of innocence, wounded in all your powers, and dead in your soul.

This is a terrible disaster.

Jesus lifted His eyes and saw it. Seeing it, He weighed how heavy that going down was, the fall, the wounding, the stripping, and the death. And as He weighed the greatness of the fall, He was troubled in spirit and agonized until He sweat blood.

Why? Because He had to repair that going down, that fall, that stripping, that wounding, and that death by a hard death of His own.

How? Like this:

Man, foolishly, wickedly, and without wisdom, wanting to be like God, exalted himself wrongly. The Son of God, wisely and rightly, wanted to become man and humbled Himself.

Why? Because there was no better way for man to be raised from his fall, from his stripping, from his wounding, and from his death, and to be brought back into his first state.

Because man exalted himself, God humbled Himself: man wrongly, God rightly; man in sin, God in grace.

Man wanted to know everything, to be like God in knowledge; God in turn wanted to become as a small, seemingly ignorant child. Man wanted to rob God of His wisdom; the Son of God, who was equal with the Father without robbery, chose to be a suffering servant.

Man was robbed by devils; the Son of God was robbed for man by soldiers and by Jews. The devil defeated man at a tree; the Son of God defeated the devil on a tree.

Eve looked at the tree cheerfully and with delight (Genesis 3:6); Mary stood by the cross sorrowful and in pain (John 19:25). Adam took sweet fruit from the tree, ate it (Genesis 3:6), and brought death on himself and his offspring; Christ on the tree drank vinegar and gall mixed with myrrh and died in His body (John 19:30), and made His children alive in their souls.

So what man lost, the Son of God restored: losing grace, man was brought back into grace; being stripped and wounded, he was brought back to full health.

For God had given man health in paradise so that nothing, either within him or outside him, could have harmed him. No pain would have pierced him, no labor wearied him, no shame disgraced him, no cold hurt him, no terror frightened him, no sickness weakened him, no care made his limbs feeble.

He had life without death. There was no conflict in him between the law of the body and the law of the will, but perfect rest. His memory was without forgetfulness; his understanding without confusion. His will was very free, for he had real power not to sin.

Such health man had before the fall. But when he went down, he was stripped of God’s grace and virtue and wounded so that now pain stings him, labor burdens him, shame dishonors him, heat scorches him, cold chills him, fear strikes him, strength fails him, sicknesses multiply for which in the end doctors cannot help.

The body fights against the soul. It is hard to learn. Memory fades. Reason wanders. And worst of all: here on earth man cannot live without daily sin.

So wounded is he that Isaiah says (Isaiah 1:6) he is wounded “from the sole of the foot to the top of the head”—in body and in soul. From the heel—that is, from the lowest thoughts—up to the crown of the head—that is, to the highest understanding, in which there is much darkening through foolishness and many other hindrances.

Is this not a great wounding, in both body and soul? Are there few wounds? Few pains, leading all the way to half-death? No, the whole man is dead, first in soul and then in body.

Truly, a heavy fall. There can be no worse than into the eternal fire of hell; nor any greater stripping than being deprived of all joy; nor any greater wounding than the eternal torment of hell.

Jesus lifted His eyes and showed us man fallen, stripped, wounded, and dead, saying: “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers, who stripped him, and after laying wounds on him, went away, leaving him half-alive.”

Who could help such a miserable one? A priest? A prophet? No one but the Son of God.

Why? Because they had gone down by the same road.

So the Savior says: “It happened that a certain priest was going down that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.”

That priest represents all priests, and that Levite all the prophets. Being themselves stripped, wounded, and dead, they could not help man.

But who could? The Lord Jesus shows us, saying: “But a certain Samaritan, traveling, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion. He came near, bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and putting him on his own beast, brought him to an inn and took care of him.”

And who is that merciful Samaritan—willing and powerful enough to heal someone so fallen, so stripped, so wounded, so sick, so near death? Surely the Son of God, Christ, is that Samaritan.

For “Samaritan” means “watchman.” And who is a better watchman than Christ, who in His divinity never sleeps, neither by night nor by day, and without whose guarding no one can guard anything? As David says (Psalm 127:1): “Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman stays awake for nothing.”

This Samaritan “traveling the road,” or “going along the way,” means that He, being made man for us, walked alongside the wounded man. He took on Himself, apart from sin, our sufferings: hunger, thirst, heat, cold, distress, pain, and death.

As Saint Paul says (Hebrews 2:17), He had to be made like His brothers in everything, though He did not take sin upon Himself in such a way that He would sin.

Being moved with mercy, He came near—so near that He could not be nearer. For, being God, He did not choose to take on an angelic nature, as Saint Paul says (Hebrews 2:16), but, being God, He chose to become man, so that, being poor, needy, sorrowful, and mortal, He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest before God, to have compassion on the sins of the people. For because He Himself suffered and was tempted, He is able to help those who suffer temptation.

Behold how close He has come to the wounded man.

He bound up his wounds so well that all his powers—of soul and of body—can be restored, so that in blessedness man will be as healthy as he was in paradise. He bound them up, pouring on oil and wine: the oil of mercy and the wine that gladdens the heart.

He set him on His own beast—that is, He took on suffering for him in His own flesh. As He says through David (Psalm 73:22): “I was made a beast before You.” He brought him to the inn, that is, into the congregation of God’s holy people, where the sick lie and repent of their sins. And He took great care of him, more than thirty-two years living among us in suffering for him.

“And on the next day”—that is, in the time of grace—“He took out two denarii,” meaning He made known the Old and the New Testaments, “and gave them to the innkeeper,” that is, to the priest, whose task is to shovel out the dung of sins.

O innkeepers, you dung-shovelers! May God grant that you first shovel out from yourselves the filth of your own stinking sins!

“And He said, ‘Take care of him,’” meaning: heal him, do not fleece him; do not strip him, do not wound him more and kill him. “And whatever you spend,” that is, whatever labor, help, and strength you lay out for him, “when I return,” that is, on the day of judgment, “I will repay you.”

Now we hear the teaching of our glorious Savior. We hear of our stripping, our wounding, our fall, and our death. And we also hear of the great mercy of our Savior, that He, being God, was willing to humble Himself by taking on our humanity, in order to restore on the cross what Adam lost at the tree in paradise.

It was easy and quick to sin. It took long, and cost dearly, to restore what was lost.

Adam and Eve suffered much, repenting here in this world. And for many thousands of years after their death they remained in a dark prison.

We blame Adam and Eve, and yet we sin even more, though we already have their example as a warning.

Eve tried to put the blame on the serpent when she excused herself before God; Adam put it on Eve. She said (Genesis 3:13): “The serpent deceived me.” Adam said (Genesis 3:12): “The woman You gave me, she gave me from the tree, and I ate.”

We, however, put the guilt on the serpent, on Eve, and on Adam—and so, in the end, we push the blame back onto God, when we, being guilty, excuse ourselves from our sins.

Knowing, then, that such excuse-making is itself a great sin, let us put away both our sins and our excuses. Let us love God above all other things, and love our neighbor—Jesus Christ the man, our dearest Brother—who goes on to say:

“Which of these three seems to you to have been a neighbor to the one who fell among the robbers?” And he answered, “The one who showed mercy to him.” And Jesus said, “Go, and you also do the same.”

What does that mean: “Go, and you also do the same”?

It means: Be merciful to your neighbor as I am merciful. Do not show favoritism, just as I do not show favoritism. Suffer for the salvation of your neighbor, as I have suffered. Weigh My suffering, for I have weighed your stripping and your wounding.

From one good question of that Jewish teacher, the Lord Jesus has given us so much good teaching: that we might recognize our own lack, highly value His goodness to us, love Him with all our heart, be merciful to our neighbor, and so attain eternal life by the help of God and through the merit of our gracious Lord Christ.

Amen.
