# Fifth Sunday After Holy Trinity  
Luke 5:1–11

At that time the crowds were pressing in toward Jesus to hear the word of God. He was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret, and he saw two boats standing by the lake; the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets. He got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and from the boat he was teaching the crowds. When he finished speaking, he said to Simon: “Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.” Simon Peter answered him: “Master, we have worked hard all night and caught nothing; but at your word I will let down the nets.” When they did this, they enclosed a great number of fish, and their nets were tearing. They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink. When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus’ knees and said: “Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.” For fear had surrounded him and all who were with him at the catch of fish they had taken; and so also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon: “Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.” And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.

A. We first read this holy story in its plain, historical sense, as the deed itself happened, and that is easy enough to understand. But according to the spiritual sense, it has many great meanings—understandings which a faithful soul can, by the gift of God, grasp.

Notice first that “the crowds were pressing in toward Jesus to hear the word of God.” Jesus was a good preacher: he acted first, and then he preached. He rebuked sins. He taught virtues. He healed the sick. He kindly received sinful women and sinful men. He gladly kept company with those who were repenting, and he forgave their sins. He rebuked lies. He spoke the word of God. That is why “the crowds were pressing in toward him to hear the word of God.”

Nothing pulled these crowds away from Jesus: the wilderness did not separate them from him, hunger did not drive them off, a priestly curse did not push them away, and later even the terror of death did not frighten them back. So the Scripture rightly says: “The crowds were pressing in toward Jesus to hear the word of God.” And even now faithful Christians press in toward Jesus to hear his word.

It goes on: “He was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret.” The gracious preacher preached beside the lake, on the shore. And when he was being pressed by the crowds, he stepped into a little boat and, “sitting down, he taught the crowds from the boat.” In this he showed his great diligence for our salvation, and the freedom that holy preaching ought to have—that it should have freedom in the wilderness, by a lake or a bay or by the sea, and even on the sea, whenever people are willing to listen.

Set that beside what happened in our own time: Priest Zbyněk, Archbishop of Prague, together with the canons, had bought a bull from Pope Alexander V. In it he commanded that the word of God was not to be preached anywhere except at parish churches, monasteries, and collegiate churches—not even in chapels that had been confirmed by popes. And from that bull, with God’s help, I appealed to that pope; and he died soon after the bull was issued, and the chancellor died as well. Then I appealed to his deputy, John XXIII. When I found no help from him for the freeing of the word of God, I appealed to the Lord God, to Jesus, the exalted and righteous Bishop, that he would judge me. And I preach in towns, in castles, in the fields and in the forest; and if I could anywhere in like manner, I would preach on the shore and from a boat, just as the Savior did, giving us an example. For the Scripture says: “The crowds were pressing in toward Jesus to hear the word of God. And he was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret.”

B. Now know this, in the spiritual sense: the lake of Gennesaret represents the unsteadiness of this life in the world. In it, as on the sea, at one time there is a rising by the wind of pride, at another time a falling down into troubles. It is rightly called Gennesaret, that is, “the beginning of birth,” because this misery begins at once in the mother’s womb. It also stinks like the sea, and in it there is war of one person against another, as in the sea among the fish—so that just as fish destroy and devour one another, so people destroy one another.

Christ’s standing by the sea represents his divinity, firmness above all creation. The two boats represent two peoples: the Jewish people and the Gentile people. Christ’s entering Peter’s boat represents Christ’s incarnation from the Jewish people; and from that boat, sitting in the virtues as if standing upon the earth, he taught the chosen ones.

Peter’s catch, at which the nets were tearing, represents the gathering of Christians, from whom some will fall away. The help of the other partners who came to Peter represents the help of converted Gentiles to the Jewish people. Peter’s and his partners’ leaving everything represents the leaving of worldly rule by the clergy, who ought to follow Christ.

There are still other teachings in this reading. First, that people must be eager to hear the word of God; that is shown when it says “the crowds were pressing in toward Jesus to hear the word of God.” Second, that a preacher must wash his nets—that is, he must cleanse his speech with which he is to fish people for Christ out of the sea of this world—so that he preaches the pure law of God, not fables, not lies, not useless talk, and above all not words by which he would lead people astray or rob them.

Third, whoever fishes at night—that is, in mortal sin—catches nothing for his salvation; and especially a priest, if he preaches while in mortal sin. Fourth, a preacher must lift his life above others and know the Lord God more deeply. For Christ says to Peter: “Put out into the deep.” And when a preacher does that, then with the nets of the word of God, at Christ’s command, he will draw many people up out of the sea of this world—that is, out of pride, out of anger, out of fornication, and out of other sins. But the nets are torn, because many who begin to be good through the preaching of the word of God later turn back.

C. And know this: there are three kinds of nets.

First are Christ’s nets. These are the bundle of virtues in the law of Christ. These nets are tied together by the thread of holy love in the chosen sons of God. This thread must run in six directions: first upward to God; then toward people; upward to the saints in heaven; downward to the saints in the fore-hell; to the right, here, toward friends; to the left toward enemies; behind us toward the holy fathers of old; and forward toward those who are yet to come.

Second are the devil’s nets. These are the bundle of vices, tied together by the devil’s envy. About those nets the prophet Abakuk says (1:15) that the devil has drawn the people into his dragnet and gathered them into his net. And David says (Psalm 141:10): “Sinners will fall into his nets.” Woe to those who are in his nets!

Third are worldly nets—human statutes and arrangements which have no foundation in God’s law. Into these nets both secular people and clergy are caught.

Let us hold firmly to Christ’s nets, so that we do not remain forever in the devil’s net. Let us mend the nets of love. Whatever we have neglected in loving God and our neighbor, let us wash it with tears and with holy repentance.

In this reading I also notice Christ’s great humility, that he asked Simon to push the boat a little away from the land, that is, from the shore. In this he teaches lords and prelates to lead their subjects to obedience more by humble request and admonition than by cruelty. For Seneca the pagan says that the noble mind of a person allows itself more easily to be led than to be dragged. Therefore, the wise first ask kindly and admonish, but fools give cruel commands. To such ones the prophet Ezekiel says (34:4): “With cruelty and with force you have ruled them.”

I also notice Peter’s humble reply, when he says: “Master!” See this: Christ asks, and Peter receives it as a command. So he says: “We have worked hard all night and caught nothing; but at your word I will let down the nets.” Peter did the will of Christ; he caught many. He fell “at the knees”—that is, at the feet—of Jesus and said: “Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.” As if he were saying: “Because of my sins I am not worthy that you should be with me in the boat.”

Here is a lesson for every person who, by admonishing, preaching, or teaching, leads many people to what is good: that he should fall on his knees before Jesus and give praise to him and not to himself, remembering that Christ says (Luke 17:10): “When you have done all the things that are commanded you, say: ‘We are unworthy servants!’”

And know this as well: when Peter says, “Depart from me, Lord,” Saint Augustine says that Peter spoke foolishly and simply—as if a sick man, when the doctor came to him and wanted to heal him, would say to him: “Depart from me, for I am sick.” That is Augustine’s word. But because Peter said it out of humility, the humble Christ stayed with him. To him be praise forever! Amen.
