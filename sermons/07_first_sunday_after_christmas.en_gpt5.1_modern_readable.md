# First Sunday After Christmas  
Luke 2:33–40

At that time the father (Joseph) and the mother (Mary) were amazed at the things that were said about the child. And Simeon blessed them, and he said to Mary his mother: “Look, this child is set for the falling and rising of many in Israel, and as a sign – that is, of peace, for he has made peace between God and man – a sign that will be spoken against. And your own soul, which is his, will be pierced by a sword – a great pain – so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”

And there was a prophetess, Anna, daughter of Samuel, from the tribe of Asher, one of the twelve patriarchs. She was very advanced in years. She had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity, and then she was a widow until eighty‑four years old. She did not leave the temple when it was time to be there, but served God with fasting and prayer night and day. And she came up at that very hour, when Mary brought the child to the temple, and she praised the Lord and spoke about him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Israel – the Jewish people, who still carry the name of Israel, that is, Jacob.

And when they had completed everything in the temple according to the law of God, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth, where Christ had been announced. And the child grew in body and became strong, filled with wisdom – just as full as he is today – and the grace of God was upon him.

This reading first shows us that Joseph, the supposed father but the true foster‑father of Christ, and Mary, his true mother, were amazed at all that had happened to the child Jesus from the time of his birth.

Angels had appeared and sung when he was born. Shepherds had come and, as the angels had told them, found the child lying in a manger. Later the three kings came, bowed down before him, and offered their gifts.

So Luke 2:33 says: “The father and mother were amazed at what was said about him.”

The angel had said: “I bring you great joy that will be for all the people, because a Savior has been born to you; he is the Christ.” Should we not be amazed?

Isaiah 9:6 had already said: “His name will be called Wonderful.” Why? Because he is called *Emmanuel*, that is: God with us.

Is it not a wonderful thing that the eternal God is with us, a temporary human being; the immortal with the mortal; the immeasurable God as a tiny child; the One whom even heaven cannot contain contained in the womb of the Virgin Mother; the impassible One willing to suffer; the glorious One becoming poor?

This is truly a wonderful thing, which pagans and Jews refuse to accept, saying it cannot be. But the “Wonderful” God has given us this gift so that we would stand in holy amazement and give great thanks to his grace: that by his immeasurable power, for our salvation, the Eternal One chose to be with us as a man, to redeem us sinners from our sins.

For the angel said to Joseph in Matthew 1:21: “You shall call his name Jesus – that is, Savior – because he will save his people from their sins.”

Who would not marvel that God wanted to become our brother, and chose to be like us in everything except sin? As Saint Paul says, Ad Heb. 2, 11: he wanted “in all things to be made like his brothers,” so that by taking on humanity he chose to be hungry with us, cold with us, thirsty with us, in pain with us – and even mortal with us.

Who would not be amazed that the angel announced it, the power of God accomplished it, the Holy Spirit came, the Virgin believed, by faith conceived, as a virgin gave birth, remained a virgin, and bore God?

The eternal God, begotten of the Father, was born as a man from the Virgin. A wonderful thing!

And that rich Lord of all the world did not have a place in his own town in the common lodging house. As Luke 2:7 says: “She laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn” – that is, in the shared house used by those who had no other lodging.

Joseph and Mary, seeing and considering all this, were amazed.

Second, this reading shows that Simeon, that holy priest, blessed them – Christ and his mother – not because he was greater, but as the older man blessing the younger. And this blessing was not just a waving of the hand, but an act of giving praise.

So even someone “lesser” can bless someone “greater.” Scripture even says in Daniel 3:57: “Bless God, all creatures of God.” That is: praise him – just as elsewhere Scripture says (Psalm 148:4).

Simeon then said to Mary, speaking prophetically: “Look, this one is set for suffering and for the fall of many” – that is, for all who do not believe in him, and thus also for evil Christians who, though he is without fault, take offense at him and fall into damnation.

“And he is set also for the rising of many” – that is, for all who finally believe in him, so that with his help they may rise out of sin into grace and salvation.

Simeon continues: Jesus is “set for a sign,” that is, a sign of peace between God and man, “which will be spoken against” by bishops, priests, scribes, and other clever men. Especially these, taught by the devil, spoke against – that is, spoke in opposition to – that precious Savior who was set as the sign of peace between God and man, between angel and man, and between man and man.

For he has reconciled God and angels with humanity, and also reconciled people with one another. That is why he is called the Prince of Peace. To honor him and to comfort the people, when he was born the angels sang (Luke 2:14): “Peace to people on earth who are of good will!”

When he lived with his disciples, he spoke to them very often about peace, and he wanted it from them. He said to them in John 14:27: “I leave you peace; I give you my peace!”

Simeon then prophesies what will come upon the Virgin Mary, saying: “And your soul, which is his, will be pierced by a sword.”

Your soul – which is “his” soul by creation and by God’s eternal choice for salvation – “will be pierced by a sword,” that is, by the pain of his torture and death.

So “your‑his” belongs together as one thought. If you say “your soul,” you speak rightly; but if you add “his,” in line with this meaning, you speak even better.

And since this sword of sorrow, caused by Christ’s suffering, was not without purpose, Simeon adds: “so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”

This can first be explained in this way: that the constant thinking of the apostles during the three days when they doubted his resurrection would be revealed to the holy church – that they had wavered, while the Virgin Mary, during those same three days, preserved the faith of the holy church, bearing great pain because of his suffering.

Second, according to the interpretation of Origen: the Virgin Mary was allowed to pass through such great sorrow because of her Son’s suffering, so that the hidden thoughts – the secret sins – of repentant, grieving hearts toward her would be revealed and, through her merit, forgiven.

Third, it may be understood like this: “that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed” – that is, that she, like a chest or ark, who through that great sorrow preserved in her heart the faith and the deeds of Christ, would stir up the hearts of the apostles to make those deeds known by writing them down for the holy church. And so it happened: from the heart‑sorrow of the Virgin Mary, the thoughts of many hearts were brought to light.

The reading then says: “There was also a prophetess, Anna.”

In her first state, as a virgin without a husband, Anna was a chaste maiden. Second, after her virginity, when she was given in marriage, she lived honorably with her husband for seven years. Third, after her husband’s death, she held to widowhood devoutly until she was eighty‑four.

So she was worthy to bear witness to the Lord Christ.

And it is not without purpose that Luke carefully records both her life and her lineage. For she foreshadows the states of the Virgin Mary: before she was betrothed to Joseph, Mary was, like Anna, a virgin; after her betrothal she truly was Joseph’s wife, even though she never intended to exercise marital relations; and after Joseph’s death she lived as a widow.

This Anna is the third Anna named in Holy Scripture. The first good Anna was the mother of the great prophet Samuel (1 Reg. 1, 2). The second Anna was the wife of old Tobit and mother of young Tobit. The third Anna is this one in our reading, daughter of a man called Samuel from the tribe of Asher, one of the twelve sons of Jacob.

The reading continues: “She did not leave the temple” – that is, when it was the proper time to be in the temple – “serving with fasts” – that is, with many fasts – “and with prayers, night and day.”

In this way serves everyone who earnestly avoids sin and uses the time lent by God to pray. As Saints Augustine and Gregory say: the sleep of a good person and every one of his deeds are not without reward.

So Saint Augustine says something like this: If you go out to plow and you do not intend to move the boundary marker, and you are free from mortal sin, then you are praising God. If you go to market and do not intend to cheat, then you are praising God. If you sit at the table to feed yourself and you do not overeat, you are praising God. And so it is with other ordinary works.

Anna, then, at that very hour when Christ was offered in the temple, praised the Lord God and spoke about his greatness and about the Virgin Mary to all the faithful who were waiting for the redemption of the people of Israel.

The text then says: “When they had completed everything according to the law of God” – that is, when his mother, according to the law, had presented him in the temple and redeemed him with two doves or two pigeons, as Luke writes – “they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth,” where Christ had been announced and where he was brought up.

“And the child grew” – that is, in body, as other children grow – “and became strong” – also in body. In this he was like us: he grew and became physically stronger when he was a man than when he was a child, even though, as a child, as God he held and governed the whole world.

So that we would not think he grew and became stronger in his soul, the reading immediately adds: “filled with wisdom.” That child was as full of wisdom then as he is today. Christ as man is not one bit wiser today than he was immediately after his conception in the Virgin’s womb.

And it continues: “and the grace of God was upon him.” For he was true God, full of grace, who from great mercy chose to become a child for us.

To him be praise forever.
