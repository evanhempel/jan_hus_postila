# Sixth Sunday After Christ’s Birth

Matthew 11:25–30

At that time—when Jesus had just pronounced woe on the unbelieving Jews, and when the apostles had come back saying that even demons obey them—Jesus lifted his eyes to heaven and said:  
“I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things—the mysteries about my coming—from the wise, those who think themselves wise, and from the prudent, that is, the clever. And you have revealed them to little ones, that is, to the humble. Yes, Father, because this was pleasing in your sight.  
All things—even that I exist and that I possess all things—have been given to me by my Father. No one has known the Son, from eternity, except the Father. And no one has known the Father, from eternity, except the Son and the Holy Spirit, and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.  
Come to me, all of you who labor and are burdened with heavy customs, all you who trust in me with hope and love as your Father and your Brother, and I will feed you, I will refresh and restore you. Take my yoke, my new law, willingly upon you, and learn from me—not how to create a world—but that I am gentle in my dealings and humble in heart, deep within the soul. And you will find rest from misery for your souls, both here and after death. For my yoke—love of God and of neighbor—is sweet, and my burden is light.”

Our merciful Savior, as man, gives thanks to God the Father because he has hidden his mysteries and his gifts from the proud, clever people of this world, and has revealed them to the humble. And then he calls to himself all who labor and struggle, by grace, for their salvation. He commands them to take upon themselves his commandments, which are to love God and to love one’s neighbor, and thus to be gentle and humble as he was gentle and humble in heart, loving God and our salvation.

This we must do, because his yoke and his burden are light and sweet—especially because they lead to eternal rest.

So our merciful Savior speaks like this: “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth!”

Christ praises God the Father for three things. First, because he is his eternal Father. Second, because he is Lord of the whole world. Both of these are included when he says, “Father, Lord of heaven and earth”—that is, Lord of all things that are in heaven and on earth. Third, he praises him because he has hidden heavenly wisdom from the clever.

This is how it was with the priests, the doctors, and the teachers of the law, and with all who busy themselves with worldly cleverness—like all those who have abandoned God’s commandments, abandoned the gentleness and humility of the Savior, and have clung instead to unworthy profits and customs of this world.

And Christ praises the Father also because he has revealed heavenly wisdom to little ones—that is, to the humble, as his disciples were.

To hide and to reveal the wisdom of God—these are works of God’s righteousness, and therefore they flow from the eternal will of God. That is why Christ says: “Yes, Father, because this was pleasing in your sight.”

Here we do not need to ask many questions about the reasons for God’s righteousness. Just as it is just that God hides his wisdom from the proud and the clever, so it is just that he reveals wisdom to his humble ones. For if either of these were not just, then it would not be pleasing to God the Father.

So when someone asks, “Why did God choose poor men as apostles?” the quick and sufficient answer is: because it pleased him so.

Look—*the greatest wise man* says, “I praise you,” that is, “I give you thanks, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things”—the mysteries of my coming, as the explanation says—and all the things that finally lead to salvation.

And what are these things? Listen to what he says: “All things have been given to me by my Father.”

From this understand that with the Father he is equal in power, in wisdom, and in goodness. He is almighty, all‑knowing, and of immeasurable goodness, just as the Father is. And these things are hidden from clever pagans, from the Jews, and from other heretics.

Averroes, the philosopher who explained Aristotle’s books, did not recognize this. He said that Christians are fools for believing in a Trinity in the Godhead. Arius the heretic did not recognize it either, holding that Christ is not the true Son of God according to his deity. Nor did Manicheus the heretic, who claimed there are two beginnings and therefore two gods: one who created heavenly things and spirits, and another who created earthly things.

Christ overthrows those clever men when he says “Father”—that is, my Father according to my divine person, and this stands against Arius. Then he says “Lord,” that is, Creator of heaven and earth and all things, and this stands against Manicheus. Then, “All things have been given to me by my Father,” meaning: because I am his eternal Son, I have this from him, and I am equal to him, being the second person in the Godhead—this against Averroes, against the Jews, and against all pagans.

“All things” also means all created things—“all things have been given to me by my Father”—insofar as he is man. For David says in Psalm 8:7, “You have put all things under his feet.” From the moment of his incarnation he is Lord of all things and holds all things in his power.

“And no one has known the Son except the Father”—that is, known from eternity, by his own eternal knowing—“and no one has known the Father, from eternity, except the Son, and the one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.”

Thus the saints in heaven have the knowledge of God the Father through the Son.

Do not think that by speaking this way Christ excludes the Holy Spirit, as if the Spirit did not know the Father and the Son. On the contrary, we must say that the Holy Spirit knows both the Father and the Son, and just as he is from the Father and from the Son, so also he has the knowledge of God the Father and of the Son of God from them.

But be wise here: do not say that the Father or the Son ever “taught” the Holy Spirit, as if at some point he did not know something before. And do not say that the Son of God ever “received” something from God the Father as if, according to his deity, he did not already have it.

From eternity, all three Persons know all things: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. And the Son is just as mighty a Lord as the Father, and so is the Holy Spirit.

Because many people labor to know these things and other truths about the Lord God in a state of grace, our merciful Savior gladly calls them to himself when he says: “Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened.”

“Come to me,” to me who am your Brother according to my humanity. “Come to me,” to me who am your Father and Creator according to my deity. “Come to me,” to your healer of both body and soul. “Come to me,” to your defender from the power of the devil.

“Come to me, all you who labor in the spiritual and active life, and who are burdened with the customs of the old law, and I will restore you,” taking away those burdens and giving you statutes that are light and useful for salvation. For “I will feed you” with the bread of my word, with the bread of my body, and with the bread of eternal deity, and I will not weigh you down.

“Therefore take my yoke upon you,” that is, take my new law in place of the old one, which was heavy. “And learn from me” what this means, and accept it in deed: “that I am gentle in my ways and merciful in vengeance; and humble in heart,” not desiring disorderly exaltation, but willingly enduring opposition.

And in these two sons of faith—that is, in humility and in gentleness—“you will find rest for your souls.” For I am the beginning, the middle, and the end, in whom all souls by their nature long to find rest.

No created thing, not even all creation together, can finally satisfy the soul—only the deity itself, which is immeasurable goodness. In that goodness the saints finally come to rest.

So David says in Psalm 17:15, “I will be satisfied when your glory appears.” And St. Augustine says in *Lib. conf.*: “You have made us, Lord, for yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in you.”

“For my yoke is sweet.” The yoke laid on the head—that is, on the will and reason of a person—is the loving affection of the soul toward God above all things, and toward one’s neighbor as oneself. This yoke is very sweet to the soul that has tasted that the Lord is sweet.

David urges us to this tasting when he says in Psalm 34:9, “Taste and see that the Lord is sweet.”

“And my burden is light”—that is, my new law is light. For whoever loves from the heart fulfills it.

And so the disciples of Christ, drawn along in his “cart,” teaching the people God’s law and bearing the cart—that is, fulfilling the law—have easily endured every labor and every suffering. For their driver was gentle and humble, his yoke was sweet, and his burden was light.

To carry this yoke and this burden, may our merciful Savior help us—he who is blessed with the Father forever and ever.
