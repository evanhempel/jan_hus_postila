# Fourth Sunday After Easter Night

From St. John, chapter 16, verses 5–15.

At that time Jesus said: I am going (that is, through suffering, as a true man) to him—that is, to the Father—who sent me (so that I would bear witness to the truth and die for the people). And none of you asks me, “Where are you going?” And because I have told you these things (about the troubles that are coming upon you), sorrow has filled your hearts. Yet I tell you the truth: it is good for you (indeed, it is necessary for you) that I go away; for if I do not go away (ascending to heaven after the resurrection from the dead), the Comforter (the Holy Spirit) will not come to you (in his gifts); but if I go, I will send him to you. And when he comes, he will rebuke and convict the world concerning sin (which they have), and concerning righteousness (which they do not have), and concerning judgment (which they do not fear): concerning sin, because they have not believed (in me and in my word); concerning righteousness (which I have shown them), because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer (that is, after the third day); and concerning judgment, because the prince (the devil) of this world (of evil people in this world) is already judged (for damnation). I still have many things to say to you (later), but you cannot bear them now (because of your dullness and because the time is short). Yet when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will teach you all truth (all that is useful for salvation); for he will not speak from himself (but from my Father and from me), but whatever he hears (that is, whatever he eternally wills together with the Father and with me), he will speak (within you and through you to others), and he will declare to you the things that are to come (by inward teaching), so that you may hold me as God and may teach others the same. He will glorify me (make me honored among the people), for he will take what is mine (that which is the truth) and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine (as the Father’s own); therefore I said that he (the Holy Spirit) will take what is mine and declare it to you.

The meaning of this reading is very close to the previous one, in which the merciful Savior hides many insights that were later understood through the Holy Spirit. First, he tells his disciples that he is going away from them; second, that he will send them the Holy Spirit; third, that the Holy Spirit will not come in vain, but will rebuke the world, teach the disciples the truth, and glorify Christ.

So our dear Christ says: “I am going”—through suffering, as a man—“to him,” that is, to the Father, “who sent me,” so that I would bear witness to the truth and die for the people; and I am also going in this sense: at the appointed time I will ascend to the Father in heaven. From the very beginning of his incarnation Christ was always on the way to the Father—just as each one of us, from the beginning of our life, is on the way either to salvation, and so to the heavenly Father, or to damnation, and so to the filthy devil.

“And none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’” Christ means that his going was so clearly visible from his works—that he would be blessed as a man—that none of the disciples doubted that he would be going into the blessedness of the kingdom of heaven. For even the pagans hold this: that whoever lives well in virtue will go to God in heaven. And although God is everywhere, yet in a special way he is in heaven or above the heavens, for nothing can surround or contain him. But Christ, as a man, was contained in the womb of the Virgin Mary and walked about on this earth, even though in his divinity he was everywhere; and in his spirit he descended into hell, after dying in the flesh on the cross; and then, being alive as a man again, on the day of the Ascension he went to the Father who had sent him, leading with him the chosen ones whom he had brought out of hell. About this going he had already said to them: “I am going to him who sent me.”

And because he had told his disciples about many sufferings that were coming, saying that he was sending them out as sheep among wolves, that they would be hated by all, that they would be chased from one place to another, excommunicated and killed, therefore, when he told them with sorrow that he was going to leave them, they were so troubled that at that moment they did not ask him, “Where are you going?” So he says: “None of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ but because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.”

It is natural that the words of a dear friend, when mixed with both grief and love, stir grief and pain in the hearts of friends. So the disciples of Christ, because they loved him, heard that he was troubled, and that he spoke to them tenderly about his coming troubles and theirs, and they were grieved.

But the faithful and merciful Christ comforts them, saying: “And I tell you the truth: it is good for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you.” As if he said: You love my visible, physical presence in a disordered way; therefore it is good for you that I hide my humanity from your eyes, so that the desire of your souls will be lifted upward.

Here St. Beda says: It is good for you that I bring the human nature you know into heaven, so that you will sigh for it there with a greater longing, and thus, lifting your hearts to heavenly things, you may be ready to receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit. That is Beda.

Know, then, that although the humanity of Christ ought to be loved and honored above every other creature, still a person can go astray in loving and honoring: a person can lean with his love, desire, and honor more toward the humanity of Christ—or toward some other creature—than toward the Godhead. The disciples were indeed leaning in a disordered way toward Christ’s humanity, as Peter showed when he tried to advise Christ not to suffer.

Because of that disordered attachment Christ sternly rebuked him, saying, Mt. 16, 23: Jdi po mně, Šatane! nesmýšlíš božských věcí, ale lidské. As if he said: You love me in a disordered way when you want me not to suffer; for you do not love the Godhead more than my humanity.

Those words should be taken to heart by people today who in a disordered way love the bodies of the saints and pay money to the popes to have them declared saints. And they should be taken to heart by those who, while still mortal here, want with bodily eyes to see the blood of Christ in the wafer or to see his body there; for both groups go astray.

What good does it do any saint if a pope confirms him as a saint for money—when it may be on the basis of a false opinion, by demonic deception, and false testimony, and through miserable greed? And what good is it if, through wretched greed, he confirms that an unconsecrated wafer is the holy sacramental bread and so the body of God, and if some priest’s blood, splashed on the wafer, is held to be the blood of Christ? This has actually happened in many places, especially in the bishopric of Litomyšl, where priests stained the host with their own blood—and when they were later examined, they admitted they had done it themselves.

To such greedy men, who thus lead the people astray and whose desires are disordered—turned more to wealth than to the kingdom of heaven—the Holy Spirit will not come. For since the Holy Spirit would not have come even to the apostles, who had no desire for wealth, if Christ had not gone away and cleansed them from their disordered love and fear, and if they had not disciplined themselves after his Ascension by fasting, prayer, and holy thoughts—how then can greedy men, fornicators, simoniacs, men who live off the church like parasites, gluttons, proud people, and drunkards receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit, since the Holy Spirit cannot dwell in a person who is in mortal sin, and who rebukes the world for sin?

About him Christ says: “And when he comes, he will rebuke and convict the world concerning sin, and righteousness, and judgment.”

Christ names three errors—three sins—for which the Holy Spirit will rebuke and convict the world, that is, wicked people; for these errors almost completely surrounded the people of old.

The first error—and so the first sin that people have—is unbelief: that people, though they have so much teaching from Christ and so many proofs and benefits, still do not believe in God the Father and the Son. So that even if they believe that God the Father is God and the Son is God, they still do not believe *in* him—that is, they do not love him above all other things and they do not obey him.

This sin called unbelief, or not believing, is greater than other sins and is the root of all other sins. About this Christ says that the Holy Spirit will rebuke the world “concerning sin, because they did not believe.” Such are the Jews, pagans, heretics, and evil Christians who do not truly believe in God and therefore do not have the Holy Spirit, who will rebuke them.

Second, the Holy Spirit will rebuke the world “concerning righteousness,” which it does not have, though it ought to have it. For before his death Christ taught with his words, his actions, and his miracles, so that people would believe rightly. Rising from the dead, he confirmed the true faith with many proofs. And third, before the eyes of the apostles he clearly ascended into heaven, opening the way for all, so that by following him in good works they might live righteously and ascend after him. Because the world does not do this, Christ says that “the Holy Spirit will rebuke the world concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father,” that is, because I am the righteous man, and the world does not want to walk after me.

Third, the Holy Spirit will rebuke the world “concerning judgment,” that is, the final judgment, because they are not afraid of it—even though they know that the devil, because of sin, is already condemned to eternal damnation. So Christ says: “concerning judgment, because the prince of this world”—that is, the devil, who is king and prince over mortal sinners—“is judged,” that is, sentenced to eternal damnation.

From this you must see: just as the Jews, for not believing Christ and not believing in him, had the sin of unbelief and were justly rebuked by the Holy Spirit—also for not having the righteousness they should have had by following Christ, and third, for judging Christ’s works wrongly—so this same threefold sin remains in the world to this very day, and the Holy Spirit will rebuke people for it.

Who now—beginning with the pope—believes in God, clings to him with all desire above all other things, as one ought to cling to him? Who remembers the miracles of Christ and his holy ways so as to follow him and be righteous? And third, who among those who say that the power to interpret God’s law is in their hands, actually judges rightly and governs himself according to the law of Christ, and truly interprets the law of God? Practically no one!

By cunning interpretations they twist the whole law that commands us to follow Christ: either they twist it into some other meaning and so deceive themselves and the people, or they weaken and lighten its demands—having no fear of the judgment by which the devil has already been condemned.

But woe to that man who is the Antichrist, for Christ will kill him by the breath of his mouth, as St. Paul says, 2. Thes. 2, 8; that is, by the Holy Spirit he will throw him down. For the Holy Spirit will rebuke and convict the world concerning the sin it has, the righteousness it does not have, and the judgment it disregards; and especially he will rebuke evil priests, who more than others ought to have guarded themselves from sin, possessed righteousness, and feared the eternal judgment of damnation.

Priests must guard themselves from sin more than other people; for their sin does the greatest harm to the Christian assembly, displeases God the most, and most delights the devil. I say, it does the most harm, because the sin of a priest stains that part of the Church that ought to be the purest, and it pulls others along after him. Therefore the devil loves it very much, and God has no pleasure in them; for they, having knowledge, ought to be teaching others, while they themselves live according to the will of God. Therefore many blows await them. For Christ says, Luke 12, 47: “That servant who knows his master’s will and does not do it will be beaten with many stripes.”

And especially because they sit at table with the Lord as if they were his equals and eat bread with him and feed themselves on him, therefore Christ, through David, says with grief, Žalm 41, 10: Člověk pokoje mého, jenž jest jedl mé chleby, vzveličil na mě vysazenie. That is: He has raised himself up against me, not giving me honor—as St. Bernard says, that priests walk in honor from the wealth of God and yet do not honor him.

So who in this world, more than we priests—if we have sin, and have no righteousness, and do not fear judgment—will be rebuked by the Holy Spirit? Woe to those who have eaten the alms of the people and have not taught them, nor rebuked them for their sins! St. Řehoř says: Let us weigh what kind of sin it is before God to do nothing against sin and yet to eat the money of sins—that is, to spend the money people have given because of their sins.

And St. Bernard says: “They will come, they will come before the judgment of God, where the heavy complaint of orphans will be heard, the strong accusation—those on whose wealth they lived and whose sins they did not wash away. Woe to the fat, belching ones who eat and drink the alms and squander them on evil living, and have no care for their own soul or the souls of others! Certainly the Holy Spirit will rebuke them concerning sin.”

Then Christ says to his disciples: “I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now,” that is, because you are so troubled and dull. Here Christ gives teachers and preachers instruction: that they should not overburden those they teach nor speak words in vain when they see that the hearers cannot bear them.

“But when he comes”—that is, when he descends in his gifts without moving from his place, “the Spirit of truth”—that is, the Holy Spirit, who is the eternal truth and who loves the truth and teaches the truth—“he will teach you all the truth” that is for your salvation and for the good of the holy Church.

And so it happened: from the day of Pentecost until their deaths, the Holy Spirit taught the apostles how they should live, how they should teach the people, and how they should leave behind for the Church the written word of truth. He taught them in such a way that they reached blessedness and became living books, in which we can come to know every truth.

And because whatever the Holy Spirit teaches, the Father and the Son also teach—just as whatever the Father does, the Son and the Spirit also do—so that people would not fall into error thinking that the Spirit alone teaches all truth and Christ not at all, he goes on to say: “For he will not speak from himself, but whatever he hears”—that is, from God the Father and from the Son. For all the knowledge of the Holy Spirit is from the Father and the Son, just as the Holy Spirit himself proceeds from the Father and the Son.

So whatever the Holy Spirit teaches anyone, or says to anyone, he has eternally “heard” it from God the Father and from the Son—not with bodily ears, which he does not have, since he is pure, bodiless Spirit—but this “hearing” is the agreement of his will in every truth with God the Father and God the Son.

And because the Holy Spirit teaches in an orderly, unhurried way, Christ adds: “and he will declare to you the things that are to come.” And so he taught the apostles that they, in turn, declared and wrote down future truths. To John, the Holy Spirit said in the *Apok.* what led him to describe the whole Christian condition, how it would go on until the Day of Judgment. To Peter, he revealed that at the end of the world there would be preachers and priests who are greedy, immoral, and lying, who with invented speeches would deceive people for money—that is what Peter writes in the second epistle, chapter 2, verses 1 and 3. Also to St. Paul the Holy Spirit said, II. Timoteovi 4, 3–4, to write about things yet to come: that at the end of the world people would be evil, would turn their ears away from the truth, turn to myths, and gather for themselves flattering teachers to tickle their ears.

And so you can see it fulfilled also in the other apostles: the Holy Spirit taught them about future things.

And because in this world the Holy Spirit did not teach the apostles everything, but after their deaths in glory he made those things known to them, Christ first says: “Whatever he hears he will speak,” that is, there in joy; and then he says: “and he will declare to you the things that are to come,” that is, here. Notice: he says “the things that are to come,” but he does not say: all things that are to come he will declare to you. For some future things he did not tell them while they were alive, and some he did tell them.

Then the Savior says: “He will glorify me,” that is, he will make me be regarded as glorious among the people, because people taught by the Holy Spirit will regard me as the glorious God. “For he will take from what is mine,” that is, from what is the truth, “and declare it to you,” so that you may hold me as God and may teach others the same.

And Christ proves that he is God and that everything the Holy Spirit says is also his. Therefore he says: “All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take from what is mine and declare it to you.” Look, in this saying he clearly shows the holy Trinity, that is, three eternal Persons: he shows the Father, and the Holy Spirit, and himself, the Son of God. For when he says, “All that the Father has,” there you see one Person, the Father; “is mine,” there you see the Son; and when he says, “he will declare it to you,” that is the Holy Spirit, the third Person.

And that Christ is equal to God the Father—and so that he is God—this is what he means when he says, “All that the Father has is mine.” And since the Father has the Holy Spirit, then the Son, Christ, also has him. And because all things that are Christ’s are the Father’s, it is true that whatever the Holy Spirit says is also Christ’s, and so also the Father’s. And whatever the Holy Spirit says, he says to the glory of the Father and of the Son and to his own glory, so that we may glorify God with honor, believing that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are three glorious Persons, almighty and eternal, and that whatever one Person does, each Person does—and thus, whoever receives the witness of one Person receives the witness of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

So even if the whole world here declares a man to be a heretic, if Christ himself bears witness that this man is his faithful servant, then the truth will set him free—truth that conquers everything and stands forever.

Blessed be the Lord God of truth, who does not finally abandon his faithful servants in their disgrace. Amen.
