Jan Hus’s sermon on Matthew 13:24-30 focuses on the parable of the wheat and the tares, explaining its spiritual meaning and its application to the church and the world. This summary highlights key points from his exposition.

### Bullet Points:
1. **Parable Summary**: The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man sowing good seed, but an enemy sows tares among the wheat. The master tells his servants to let both grow until harvest.
2. **Interpretation**:
   - The sower is Christ, the field is the world, and the good seed represents the children of the kingdom.
   - The tares are the sons of the evil one, sown by the devil.
   - The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.
3. **Application**:
   - Preachers and leaders must not hastily judge or uproot supposed tares, as they may harm the wheat (the faithful).
   - Evil coexists with good in the world to test and strengthen the faithful.
4. **Critique of Church Leaders**: Jan Hus criticizes church leaders for their failure to distinguish between truth and error, often favoring lies over truth and harming the faithful.
5. **Final Judgment**: At the end of the age, angels will separate the tares (the wicked) from the wheat (the righteous). The tares will be burned, while the wheat will be gathered into God’s kingdom.

### Key Quote:
> "Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, 'Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'" — Matthew 13:30
