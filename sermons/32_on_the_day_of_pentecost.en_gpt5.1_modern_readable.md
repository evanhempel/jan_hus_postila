# On The Day Of Pentecost

At that time Jesus said: “If anyone truly loves me above all other things, he will keep my word in action, and my Father in heaven will love him – and I too will love him – and we will come to him, to the one who loves me, and we will make our dwelling with him forever. Whoever does not love me does not keep my words in action. And the word you hear is not only mine, but the word of the Father who sent me. I have spoken these things to you while I have been staying with you, living among you in the body. But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send to you as a gift in my name – that is, from me and in my name – he will teach you all things that are worthy of salvation, things you cannot understand now, and afterward he will bring back to your memory all the things that I will tell you, which you do not yet grasp at the proper time. Peace – which is the rest of the soul from sin – I leave with you as an example, so that you may be at peace with people as I am. My peace – which is reconciliation with God – I give to you; I do not give to you as the world, that is, the people of this world, give – that is, a peace which is simply a quiet enjoying of a season. I give you peace without notable interruption from your enemies. Let your heart not be troubled because of my death, which is your redemption, and let it not be afraid because of your own death and the sufferings to come. You have heard that I said to you, ‘I am going’ – to death – ‘and I am coming to you’ – on the third day. If you loved me fully, you would surely rejoice that I am going to the Father, that is, on the day of the Ascension, for the Father is greater than I, in so far as I am a man; for the Father is God, but he, as a man, is a creature. And now I have told you beforehand, before it happens, so that when it does happen you may believe that I told you, as God who knows the things to come. I will no longer speak many things with you – that is, before my death – for the ruler of this world, the devil, has come, the prince of this evil people, and he has nothing in me, not a single sin. But this is so that the world, that is, the people of the whole world, may know that I love the Father: I choose to die to fulfill the prophecies, to redeem the elect, and to give an example of obedience to the Father. And just as the Father has given me a command, so I do: I preach the word of God and go to death for your salvation.”

Today is the feast of the Holy Spirit, who on a day like this was given in his gifts to the apostles and to other believers who were with them; and even today that same Spirit will be given in special grace to many who repent of their sins, guard themselves from them, and grow in the love of God, by truly keeping the word of their Savior, Jesus Christ.

Because today’s Gospel reading speaks of the Holy Spirit, the holy Church reads this passage at mass, so that by remembering the feast of the Holy Spirit – who is true God – she may be made worthy to receive his gifts; and she will receive them when she keeps his commandments, and so loves Jesus Christ, who, beginning this reading, says to his disciples, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word.”

In these words our gracious Savior gives many teachings to his faithful ones. First, he teaches them how they can know whether they really love him. Second, that they must carefully keep his word. Third, that the Holy Spirit will teach them to do this. Fourth, he comforts his disciples. Fifth, he shows that he goes to the Father through death, and that after death he will quickly come back to them – and that he does all this in order to fulfill what the Father has commanded him.

On the first point he says: “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word.” Understand this and hold it in your memory, thinking on it sweetly, writing it down if you can, but most of all fulfilling it in action. This is what God commands. And so the Savior says: If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, believing and doing what I have commanded. From this a person can know whether he loves Christ. So says Saint Gregory: If each of you were asked, “Do you love God?” you would answer with full confidence and a sure mind, “I do love him!” But at the beginning of the reading you heard the Truth say, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word.” Therefore the proof of love is shown by deeds. For this reason John, in his first letter (1 John 2:4), the same John who wrote this Gospel, says: “Whoever says, ‘I love God,’ and does not keep his commandments is a liar.” For we truly love God when, for the sake of his commandments, we hold back from our own pleasures; because whoever still runs after improper desires surely does not love God, for he opposes God by following his own will. So far Gregory.

From Gregory’s words, and from Christ’s, you learn first that whoever loves God keeps all his commandments. Second, you learn that whoever loves God has fulfilled the whole law of God, as far as is necessary for his salvation. Therefore Saint Paul says to the Romans (Romans 13:10): “Love is the fullness of the law.” And because the love of Christ does not go without a reward, Christ immediately goes on and says:

“And my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him.”

In this sentence the Savior promises three rewards to the one who loves him – rewards that go far beyond every papal indulgence. The first reward is that the Father will love the one who loves Christ; and so the whole Holy Trinity and all the heavenly kingdom will love him. The second reward is that Christ will come with the Father to this lover of Christ – that is, he will visit him with a special grace, and so also will the Holy Spirit. The third reward is that Christ will make his dwelling with this lover, together with the Father – that is, he will stay with that person with the Father and with the Holy Spirit as long as that person keeps Christ’s word.

O dear human being, does it seem to you a small reward that for keeping Christ’s word the Holy Trinity will love you, will come to you, and will dwell in you by grace? This is truly a great reward: to have such a great guest in your soul!

Therefore Saint Gregory says here: “Consider, dearest brothers, how great a feast it is to have God come as a guest into the inn of the heart” – that is, to have God as a guest in the heart. If a rich or powerful friend came into our house, we would, with all effort, clean the whole house so there would be nothing there that would offend his eyes. In the same way, whoever is preparing a house in his mind for God must clean out the filth of evil deeds. And notice what the Truth says: “We will come and make our dwelling with him.” For in some hearts God comes, but he does not make his dwelling. Such people receive God’s grace in their sorrow and contrition, but after a time of temptation they forget it, and turn back again to their sins as if they had never wept over them.

But whoever truly loves God and keeps his commandments – into that person’s heart God comes and makes his dwelling. For God’s love so pierces that person that he does not turn away from that love at the time of temptation. The one who truly loves God is the one whose mind an evil desire does not overcome by his consent; for the more a person delights in earthly things, the more he departs from the love of heavenly things. Therefore Christ goes on to say: “Whoever does not love me does not keep my words.”

All this Saint Gregory says, showing that it is a great feast to have God as a guest in the heart, and how careful we must be to prepare the house of our soul purely for this guest, so that when he comes he does not withdraw his grace from us, but remains with us forever. Woe to those to whom this guest never comes – like the pagans, the Jews, and unbaptized children. Woe to those to whom he once came and then went away; and again, woe to those to whom he will come and then finally depart forever. But blessed are those to whom he comes and makes an eternal dwelling with them, as he himself says: “We will come to him and make our dwelling with him.”

Because people commonly deceive themselves, saying that they love God – since all people by nature say, “I love God” – this lie must be exposed. The Jews, after killing Christ, thought that by doing so they were serving God in love; and today’s bishops and priests, when they kill those who preach the word of God, also think that they are loving God. Therefore Christ, so that people would not deceive themselves in this, speaks the truth which no one can undo: “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word.” It is not enough for a person to hear Christ’s word with physical ears – animals and birds can also hear. It is not enough to speak about it – the devil himself can do that. It is not enough to write it, to teach it, or even to think about it. It must be fulfilled in deeds. That is what it means to “keep” the word of God – that is, every one of his commandments.

It is impossible truly to keep one commandment of God while rejecting the others. Whoever does not hold to one, holds to none; and whoever fulfills one, fulfills all. For if he loves God, then in that love he keeps all of them; but if he does not love God, then he keeps none of them. Therefore the Savior goes on: “Whoever does not love me does not keep my words.” And our dear Savior, wanting his disciples to know that whoever keeps his word is also keeping the word of God the Father, adds: “And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father’s who sent me.” Because Christ is the Son of God, he has his being from God the Father, and so does his word come from the Father. Therefore Christ’s word is not only Christ’s but also the Father’s. So whoever keeps Christ’s word keeps the word of the heavenly Father. And because whatever the Father speaks, the Holy Spirit also speaks, whoever keeps Christ’s word keeps the word of the Holy Spirit – and so the word of the whole Holy Trinity.

Then the Savior says: “These things I have spoken to you” – that is, about love and about keeping my word and my Father’s word – “while I am staying with you,” that is, as your teacher and faithful friend, drawing you toward eternal joy. “But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit,” who comforts the repentant and the sorrowful, “whom my Father will send in my name” – that is, from me and in my name – shows that the Father and Christ the Son together send the Holy Spirit. Understand it this way: not that the Holy Spirit leaves heaven and comes here to the world as if changing place, but that God the Father gives the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and he gives them for the merit of the Lord Jesus. For Christ, as a man, deserved them by suffering, and as man he is less than the Father and less than the Holy Spirit. And because these gifts come not only from the Father but also from the Holy Spirit, Christ at once says: “He will teach you all things” – that is, he will teach you very well the things you cannot understand now. At this time you are confused because of my coming death, and afraid because of your own, and you are still dull in understanding. Therefore, before the Comforter comes, you must still be more clearly instructed about my resurrection from the dead and be made ready to receive the Holy Spirit. Then that Holy Spirit “will bring to your memory” – that is, later, when the Father sends him – “all the things that I have said to you.”

And so it happened. Whatever the disciples wrote in the Scriptures, they wrote by the Holy Spirit’s teaching and by the remembrance he gave them.

Then the Savior says: “Peace I leave with you” – as an example, so that you may be as peaceable as I am. The disciples did hold this peace. For after the sending of the Holy Spirit, the disciples became gentle and without quarrels. Peter no longer drew his sword to cut off anyone’s ear. They no longer argued about which of them was first or greater. Instead, each one followed Christ in peace and went to death with no bodily defense.

Now then, you “apostolic” substitutes – you bishops and church rulers – look at yourselves. Do you have the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of unity, the Spirit of peace and grace? If you did, you would live as the apostles lived. But because you fight over rank for the sake of wealth, because you murder people and cause divisions in Christendom, you show by your deeds that you have an evil spirit – the spirit of discord, the greedy spirit, who is a murderer from the beginning. And how many are there who have the spirit of sexual immorality, the devil who strangles fornicators’ souls! The apostles did not have that spirit, but the Spirit of truth. Therefore they had the peace of Christ, because they followed him in virtue. For he had said to them: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you.”

Understand that the peace of the world is a quiet enjoyment of this present time without major disturbance from enemies. This peace worldly people love very much. Whatever quarrels or battles they start, they do it always wanting to secure that kind of peace. Even robbers steal so that they may have a comfortable bodily life in peace. And that peace is commonly defiled by great sins. When people are not disturbed from anywhere, they gladly dance, feast, commit fornication, play games, and commit other sins. But when they are robbed, arrested, driven away, and beaten, then they do not have time to sin in that way. And whatever forgetfulness of God they had in times of peace, in trouble they more quickly remember God and call out to him to have mercy.

Therefore the Savior says: “My peace” – which is the calming of the soul from sin – “I give to you.” And because the world – that is, wicked people – does not love this peace, nor give it, for wicked people do not have this peace, Christ says: “Not as the world gives do I give to you.” That is, the world gives a different peace and for a different purpose than I do. The world gives peace for bodily pleasure; but I give peace for eternal rest. “Therefore let not your heart be troubled” because of my death, which is your redemption, “and do not be afraid” because of your own death and the sufferings to come.

“You heard that I said to you, ‘I am going’” – to death – “‘and I am coming to you’” – on the third day. Christ proved the meaning of these words by his deeds. “If you loved me” – that is, fully, and understood where I am going and what good I will do for you – “you would surely rejoice that I am going to the Father,” that is, through death and then, as a man, through my ascension into heaven. Yet, as God, I will always be with you. And he explains why he says he is going to the Father: “For the Father is greater than I” – that is, in so far as I am a man. For God the Father is the Creator, but Christ, as a man, is a creature. Yet according to his divinity, the Father is not greater than the Son. The persons – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – are equal, in power, in goodness, and in knowledge of all things.

Then the Savior shows why he has spoken this way, saying: “And now I have told you before it happens” – for this reason – “so that when it does happen you may believe,” that I am the Son of God, the true God, who has told you things that were still in the future. “I will no longer speak much with you” – that is, before my death – “for the ruler of this world has come,” that is, the devil, who is the prince and king over this world – that is, over wicked people – “and he has nothing in me,” that is, not a single sin. “But this is so that the world may know” – that is, all the people in the world – “that I love the Father,” that is, I choose to die to fulfill the prophecies, to redeem the elect, and to give an example of obedience to the Father. And because I love the Father by keeping his command, “just as the Father has given me command, so I do” – I preach the word of God and go to death for your salvation, and by this I prove that I love the Father.

The end of this reading confirms its beginning. Christ said: “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word.” With the same logic he shows that he loves God the Father, saying: “Just as the Father has given me command, so I do.”

Our gracious Savior first laid down the true teaching about love, and then gave an example of it in himself. Amen.
