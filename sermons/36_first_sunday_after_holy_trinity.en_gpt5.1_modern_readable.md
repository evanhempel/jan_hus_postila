# First Sunday After Holy Trinity

Saint Luke, chapter 16, verses 19–31

At that time our Lord Jesus Christ spoke this parable: There was a rich man who dressed himself in purple cloth fit for pride and in fine white linen made for pleasure, and he feasted every day in splendid luxury, in great excess and arrogance.

And there was a beggar named Lazarus, who lay at his gate, covered with sores. He longed to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table, but no one gave him anything. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.

And it happened that the beggar died, and he was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died, and he was buried in hell. And when he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, he saw Abraham far away, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried out and said, “Father Abraham, have mercy on me! Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this flame.”

But Abraham said to him, “Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and in the same way Lazarus received evil things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in torment. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who would cross from here to you cannot, and none can cross from there to us.”

He said, “Then I beg you, father, send him to my father’s house, for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them, so that they also will not come into this place of torment.”

Abraham said to him, “They have Moses and the prophets; let them listen to them.”

He said, “No, father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.”

He said to him, “If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.”

A. Why did our merciful Savior speak this holy story? Saint Luke shows us. When our poor Savior was preaching against greed, he said (Luke 16:13–15), “No servant can serve two masters… You cannot serve God and wealth.” When the priests and scribes—who were greedy—heard this, they mocked him.

Then he said to them: “You are the ones who make yourselves look righteous in front of people, but God knows your hearts.” And because they were proud, he also said to them, “What is highly exalted among people is an abomination in the sight of God.”

Right away he proved this on the rich man, who was honored and lifted up before people, but was disgusting before God. And again, Lazarus was despised by people, yet precious before God.

So our gracious Savior put these two men before us as two mirrors: so that the rich, having always before their eyes this rich man buried in hell, would be warned against pride, pleasure, and greed—those three sins that this rich man had; and so that the poor, looking at Lazarus, would be comforted and patiently bear bodily misery and being despised in this world in humility.

B. Christ has set before the inner eyes of our hearts two ladders. One leads up into Abraham’s bosom—that is Lazarus’s ladder. The other leads down into hell—that is the rich man’s ladder.

Lazarus’s ladder is built out of humility and patience, tied together with love. So we must look carefully and decide: on which ladder do we want to climb? Because without fail, every one of us is already climbing one or the other, and we will recognize which it was when we arrive either where Lazarus is, or where the rich man is.

And since in this world the rich have the first place, our Master Jesus, following their custom, also gives him first place in the reading.

C. He says, “There was a rich man.” He doesn’t give his name, because he was not written down in God’s court. But he does name Lazarus, as one whose name is written there.

So Saint John Chrysostom says: Look at the mercy of God! Lazarus, though poor, because he was holy, is named; but this rich and proud man was not worthy of a name.

This should be noticed by those who, out of pride, want their name to be spread and made famous in the world. Because the more people praise them out of pride, the more God despises them. So Scripture says (Proverbs 10:7), “The name of the wicked will rot.”

Look, this rich man’s name has rotted before God, so that God did not even want to mention it, fulfilling what he said through David (Psalm 16:4), “I will not even take their names upon my lips.” So this rich man, who glorified his name before people, lost it before God.

Why? Was it because he was rich? Certainly not. It was because he was proud, self-indulgent, and without mercy.

Listen to what the Truth says: “He was clothed in purple”—that is for pride. “And in fine linen”—that is for the sensual comfort of softness. “And he feasted every day in splendid luxury”—that is for the indulgence of the belly. And he gave nothing to Lazarus—that is lack of mercy.

D. Now understand: I have translated “purple” here where the Latin text has *purpura*. As Saint Bede says, it is a cloth dyed with the blood of sea creatures. That color, he says, is really only fitting for kings, and it is very fine and noble, beautifying the garment.

And because we do not have that cloth in our country, we don’t even know what to call it properly in Czech; so I used the word “gold-brocade,” because that’s what we see rich people wearing here as their best clothing.

And I have translated “fine linen” where the Latin has *bissus*. As Saint Bede again says, that is a very noble cloth, white and thin, and the flax for that cloth grows nowhere else but in Egypt. So in Czech we don’t know what to call it—nor do the Germans, nor even the Latins in their everyday language. Those two words, *purpura* and *bissus*, are foreign even in Latin.

Our Lord Jesus spoke of the rich man according to the clothing used in those lands, and there that purple was cheaper than our Levantine cloth here, and that linen was cheaper than our coarse linen here.

So the rich men and rich women of our day have no excuse when they say, “But we don’t wear purple and *bissus*.” Even if they don’t wear those exact things, they wear here what is even more expensive there. A fur coat of sable, marten, ermine, or pure white fur, even without any cloth, costs more than purple there. And a cap, a bedsheet, a shirt, or a head-veil of fine white cotton or silk often costs more here than *bissus* did there.

And worse than that rich fop in the gospel, people today dress even more badly in God’s sight: they have things brought here from far countries, obtained with great effort and at a high price, and then they cut them shamefully, wastefully, and to their own harm.

How, then, are they not sinning as much as that rich man buried in hell—who wore such clothes to outshine others, to be praised by them, to be admired and thought important by them, and to scare others with his proud clothing so that they would fear him?

And he wore that fine linen only for bodily pleasure, just as people now wear their delicate shirts and fine caps. Soon even shrouds, the simple burial cloths, will be forbidden almost even to peasants, because everyone wants to go about in expensive, beautiful, elegant, and luxurious clothing, and does not notice that the rich man who dressed in costly garments is buried in hell.

Here Saint Gregory says that there are many people who don’t consider eagerness for expensive and thin clothing to be a sin. But if it were no sin at all, God’s word would not say so carefully that the rich man, who dressed himself in purple and fine linen, was suffering in hell.

No one looks for expensive clothes except for empty praise—that is, to be seen as more honorable than others. And we can prove that this desire is only for empty praise by this: no one wants to wear expensive clothing in a place where people will not see him.

So says Saint Gregory, and he truly speaks the truth. Because clothing is meant to serve a person so that he can keep out the cold and cover his nakedness, and also so that he is not made a laughingstock by the people, either by ridiculous extravagance or by filthy rags. But who is willing to accept that freely and in time?

E. Christ continues: “He feasted every day splendidly.” Here Christ shows that this rich man sinned by gluttony, and that is why the title that sticks to him is “the rich man,” the pampered one, the feaster.

Know this: people sin in gluttony in five main ways.

First, when someone eats without a proper reason before the time rightly set; like Jonathan, who was condemned to death by his father because, not waiting for the set time, he tasted honey (1 Samuel 14:43–44).

Second, when someone eats in a self-indulgent way, like this rich man.

Third, when someone goes beyond what is needed, eating and drinking more than the body needs for its support; as did Holofernes, who got more drunk than ever before and paid for it with his head when Judith cut it off (Judith 12:20; 13:8).

Fourth, when someone eats or drinks in a gross, animal-like way, like a dog or a pig; as Esau did, who sold his birthright for bread and lentil stew because he rushed to fill his belly quickly (Genesis 25:34).

Fifth, when someone is too eager and obsessed with food—always thinking about what delicacies he will eat, how they will be prepared, and how he will get them. This was how the sons of Eli the priest behaved, and they were killed for it (1 Samuel 2:12–17; 4:11).

And I can say very frankly: we priests, in these five ways, generally sin in gluttony more than other people. We think nothing of breaking fasts more boldly than others; we eat in more comfort; we eat and drink to the point of belching; we eat faster than others; we invent strange dishes beyond what others have; and sadly, we hold the biggest feasts. We, who ought to be the most moderate in eating and drinking, are the most excessive.

We do not remember the words of our Savior, spoken especially to priests (Luke 21:34): “Be on your guard, so that your hearts may not be weighed down with gluttony and drunkenness and the cares of this life, and that day”—the day of judgment—“come on you suddenly.”

Now this rich man is condemned precisely because he “feasted every day splendidly”—that is, with great preparation and pleasure—while he cared nothing for the poor. So he was guilty also of the third sin: lack of mercy.

F. So Saint Gregory says: This rich man was not punished because he stole what belonged to others, but because he did not give from what was his own. Not because he crushed anyone by violence, but because he bragged about the gifts that God had given him.

From this we must carefully consider what punishment that person deserves who does take what does not belong to him, since even the one who does not give his own possessions to those in need suffers eternal damnation.

Therefore no one should feel secure and say, “Look, I do not steal from others; I just enjoy what I have been lent!” For this rich man was not tormented because he robbed others, but because, having received things from God, he used them badly on himself.

What threw him into hell was that, puffed up in his prosperity, he turned God’s gifts into pride, forgot mercy, and did not repay his sins, though he had the means to do so. So far Saint Gregory.

Now you have heard the condition of this world that the rich man lived in. Now listen to the condition of poor Lazarus.

Our Savior says of him, “There was a beggar named Lazarus,” and so on. With this description the faithful and wise preacher Christ burdens the sin of the rich man by showing the state of the poor man.

If the rich man were to say: “There were many poor people; I could not help them all,” Christ answers: “There was one.”

If he said: “He was well-off; he wasn’t really poor,” Christ says: “He was a beggar.”

If he said: “I didn’t know him,” Christ says: “By name he was Lazarus.”

If he said: “He could have worked and earned something,” Christ says: “He lay there.”

If he said: “I didn’t see where he lay,” Christ says: “At his gate,” that is, at your gate.

If he said: “He just pretended to be sick,” Christ says: “Full of sores.”

If he said: “He didn’t ask,” Christ says: “He longed to be filled.”

If he said: “He wanted money or fine food,” Christ says that he only desired “the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table.”

If he said: “My servants gave him something,” Christ says, “No one gave him anything.” Either they didn’t dare, or because a merciless rich man usually has merciless servants. There’s a proverb: like master, like servant.

So Christ has fully described the state of the beggar Lazarus, so that his reward might be more clearly shown in contrast to the miserable life he patiently endured, and so that the guilt of the rich man, for which he is condemned, might be revealed.

G. Christ adds: “Even the dogs came and licked his sores.”

Saint John Chrysostom says: Those sores which no human being wanted to touch or wash, gentle dogs came and licked. Again he says: Poor man! If you do not notice God’s command, at least have mercy on your own nature and be afraid lest you become like that rich man.

Know this: the rich man loved his dogs more than he loved Lazarus, his neighbor. The proof is that he fed his dogs—he must have, since he kept them—but he did not even give crumbs to Lazarus.

In this same sin many of today’s rich are caught: princes, lords, knights, rulers, town officials and citizens, men and women. They keep little furry pets and meat-eaters of no use at all. They bathe them, comb them, take them to the baths, cook special meat for them or buy it for them, while they will not even give a poor person a dish!

And think of how many bishops, abbots, canons, and parish priests there are who spend the property of the poor—over which they are stewards—on dogs. The alms that poor Lazaruses should be eating are devoured by their fat hounds, greyhounds, and hunting dogs—and the same with those others, their *kurvy neb ženimy*—their whores or mistresses.

Christ goes on: “And it happened that the beggar died, and he was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried in hell.”

At first the Savior showed us the difference between the rich man and poor Lazarus in this life, before death. Now he shows how different their condition is after death.

He now puts the poor man first and the rich man second, to show us that on the other side God honors the poor and righteous, and deals very differently with the rich who are evil.

He says, “And it happened that the beggar died.” He does not say, “Lazarus died,” because Lazarus only then truly began to live gloriously. He says, “the beggar died,” because his begging, his misery and distress, passed away from him.

“And he was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom”—that is, his soul was carried to the dwelling-place of the holy fathers, where the saints lived in their souls before the Son of God became man.

Here good poor people should take comfort: if people do not carry their bodies in proud funerals to the grave, angels carry them in glory to God.

Saint John Chrysostom says: Such great suffering was quickly changed into joy, that he was carried by angels. So that he would not grow weary on the way, after all his work he was carried by angels. One angel was not enough for the poor man; many came, forming a choir to sing joyfully as they carried him. Every angel rejoices to take up such a burden; they are glad to be weighed down with burdens like this, to bring people into the kingdom of heaven. He was led and carried into Abraham’s bosom—not just beside Abraham, but into Abraham’s bosom—so he could touch him, so Abraham could feed him, so that the most merciful father would hold him in his bosom and refresh and nourish him.

All that is from the Golden Mouth. And know that the place to which Lazarus was carried is especially called “Abraham’s bosom,” says Saint Augustine, not because it belongs only to Abraham, but because he is the father of many people, set before us as an example to follow in faith.

It is also called Abraham’s bosom because he was extremely hospitable to travelers and gladly received them for God’s sake. So, to make the merciless and inhospitable rich man even more aware of his sin, that place is called Abraham’s bosom.

But now Abraham’s bosom means, in a hidden sense, the Father’s rest in heavenly joy. Saint Gregory says: What is Abraham’s bosom? It simply means the hidden rest of the Father. Of this the Truth says (Matthew 8:11–12), “Many will come from the east and the west and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into outer darkness.”

I. Christ continues: “The rich man also died and was buried in hell.” His body was given to worms, his wealth to his friends, and his soul to the devils. So the rich man, having died in body, was buried in hell in his soul.

Now, what am I hearing—that the rich man died? Dear Savior, I believe you: the rich man died. But how is it that he did not buy his way out of death with his wealth? Why did he not bribe death? Why did the doctors not help him?

How strange that the rich man died! Where did they lay him, Lord Christ? Who carried him? You say he was buried in hell. I believe you, even though other rich people might prefer to believe there is no hell.

The rich man died. What kind of death? Truly three.

First, bodily death, as the poor also die. Death makes all equal; it does not favor scarlet or grey. It measures the same for all, and lays a lord with his servant, and puts a king’s scepter and a pope’s staff into the grave along with a peasant’s hoe. Let them go into the charnel house and try to sort which bones belonged to a pope, which to a king, and which to a peasant!

Death measured the same for the rich man and for Lazarus.

Second, he had already died in his soul before he let it go from his body, because he had suffocated it with bodily pleasures. In this kind of death many people today are already dead, even while their bodies live. Of this death Saint Paul says (1 Timothy 5:6) that a widow who lives in self-indulgence is dead even while she lives—that is, alive in body, dead in soul. May God grant that many rise from this death, and, brought back to life in soul, be enlightened!

Third, the rich man died with the death that is separation from eternal joy. Of this David says (Psalm 34:22), “The death of sinners is the worst of all.”

Dear Christ, deliver us from that death, for your word is terrifying: “The rich man died and was buried in hell.”

Who carried him there so quickly? Who buried him in hell—that is, in eternal damnation from which there is no deliverance?

The rich man lived, and soon he was buried in hell. For Job says (Job 21:12–13), “They sing to the tambourine and the lyre; they rejoice to the sound of the flute; they spend their days in prosperity, and in a moment they go down to hell.”

We hear this truth, and yet we still take it lightly, that those who live in pleasure go down to hell. One of them was this rich man, who died as the poor man did, but had a very different end.

Saint Augustine shows this difference in a sermon on these two men and says: The poor man could not get a crust, and the rich man could not get a drop. So tell me about these two: which one died well, and which died badly? Do not ask your eyes—turn back to your heart. If you ask your eyes, they will deceive you.

Many splendid and worldly-decorated things could have been given to that rich man when he died: crowds of weeping servants and maids, some pomp of squires, some decorated corpse. What lavish funeral expenses! I bet he was wrapped in expensive ointments.

So what shall we say, brothers? Did he die well or badly? If you ask your eyes, he died very well; but if you ask your inner teacher—your reason—he died very badly.

So, since the proud hoarders of their wealth die like this, giving nothing to the poor, how do those die who also steal what belongs to others?

That is why I told you the truth: live well so that you do not die badly, so that you do not die like this rich man. His bad death was not shown by some special time after his death.

Now look at the poor man: do not trust your eyes, or you will go astray. Let faith notice, let the heart—your understanding—see. Put him before your eyes, lying on the ground, full of sores, dogs licking him. As soon as you picture such a man before your eyes, you spit, you turn your face away, you hold your nose!

But now look with the eyes of your heart: he died, and was carried by angels into Abraham’s bosom. The rich man’s household was seen weeping, but the angels, who rejoiced, were not seen.

And what did Abraham answer the rich man? “Remember, son, that you received good things in your lifetime.” All this is from Saint Augustine.

So now you see what happened immediately after death to the rich man and to the poor man: Lazarus was buried in his Lord’s dwelling, the rich man in his own; the one with God, the other with the devil.

Christ continues: “And when he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, he saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom.”

What do I hear? The rich man lifted up his eyes in torment. Why? Because the eyes that sin closes, suffering opens.

He had fixed his eyes on the earth; now he has lifted them to Abraham. Now he sees Lazarus from far away, the one he was not willing to look at up close. His short-lived comfort is gone, and eternal damnation remains: he in torment, Lazarus in joy.

“And he cried”—he shouted—“Father Abraham, have mercy on me!”

O rich man! Now you lift up your eyes—and are you lying low enough? Now you are in torment—have they not made your bed hard enough? Now you cry out—is it hurting you?

O rich man! It is hard for you now to suffer torment, you who had such great pleasures. It is hard to lie so low, you who were so high above others. Now you will not sleep long—you slept too long before. Now they will not spread anything soft under you. You should have remembered what Scripture says in Isaiah 14: “Maggots are spread beneath you as a bed, and worms are your covering.”

Now you cry and your shout is heard through the world, because you would not hear Lazarus, though he was near you. Where did you get such a loud voice?

Saint John Chrysostom answers for you: great torments make a great voice.

O rich man! Now you feel the torment you did not know and did not care about. Now learn to endure, because you cannot escape these torments forever.

Now you cry, “Father Abraham!” You call him father, whose example you did not want to follow as a son. You are one of those proud priests’ offspring who said to Jesus (Matthew 3:9), “We have Abraham as our father.” For them Christ told this story about you.

You say, “Have mercy on me!” Foolish man, you have missed the time of mercy. In vain you try to cry out repentance in a place from which no one is delivered. It is pain that drives you to cry out, “Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.”

O rich man, you are greatly mistaken. You ask for mercy, though you refused to show mercy. You want Lazarus to come such a long way to you, when you did not even send a servant a short way to him.

You should have remembered that “judgment will be without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy” (James 2:13).

Saint John Chrysostom says: Remember, rich man, your life. You would not even look at Lazarus, and now you ask for his finger. You say, “Send Lazarus.” That is what you should have done while Lazarus was still alive—you should have gone to visit him.

That is from the Golden Mouth.

What do you want, rich man? “Let him dip the tip of his finger in water.” Now you ask for a drop of water, and you didn’t give him even a crust of bread.

Ah, sinner, says John Chrysostom, see the conscience of the sinner: he doesn’t dare ask for the whole finger. Ha! Now you ask for water—you were not willing to give the smallest thing from your table to the poor, and now you are forced to beg for the smallest thing yourself.

And why do you ask for a drop of water? “To cool my tongue.” Your tongue took in food and drink with excessive pleasure and surely spoke many unchaste, slanderous, and empty words. So where you sinned, there you suffer. Now you are tormented in the fire, since you refused to help your neighbor—or even yourself—toward grace.

So you hear Abraham say to you: “Son, remember.” “Son” by nature, but not in imitation. “Son, if you had followed me in mercy, in humility, and in moderation, you would not be suffering like this. But remember, son, that you received good things in your lifetime”—that is, you enjoyed good things in pleasure—“and Lazarus evil things”—he suffered in his body, but humbly. “Now he is comforted, and you are tormented.” For that is how it must be: those who patiently suffer in the body in this life will rejoice forever, and those who live in pleasure for a time will be tormented forever.

Christ goes on: “And besides all this, between us”—who belong to salvation—“and you”—the damned—“a great chasm has been fixed.” It is a long way from hell to heaven. A “great chasm,” says the commentary, is the vast difference in what each has deserved; and this chasm “has been fixed” by God’s justice.

“It has been fixed,” says Saint John Chrysostom; it cannot be torn down, no one can move it, no one can destroy it. We can see across it, but we cannot cross it. We see what we have escaped, and you see what you have lost. Our joy increases your torment, and your torment increases our joy. So far the Golden Mouth.

“So that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross from there to us.” Thus those chosen for salvation cannot become damned, and the damned cannot become saved.

You might say: But didn’t Saint Gregory pull the emperor Trajan out of hell after his death, and he went into heavenly joy? And don’t devils come out of hell, and good angels and saints come from heaven into this world, and at the Last Judgment won’t both those from hell and those from heaven come to the judgment?

Understand this: the “going” spoken of here means this: that no one can go from eternal damnation into eternal salvation, nor from eternal salvation into eternal damnation. That would be against God’s justice.

And from this we can answer about Trajan: if it is true that he was saved, then he was never eternally damned, but preserved by God’s grace. Though he was a pagan, because he practiced justice, the Lord God preserved him from eternal damnation.

So also the second objection is answered: although devils may come out of hell for a time, and angels or saints may come out of heaven, this does not contradict this passage. Because the devils are not freed from their torment and damnation, and the angels and saints are not separated from their salvation and comfort.

But there is still another question: how is it true that Abraham says, “Between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot”—how is it that those in Abraham’s bosom “want” to go to those in hell, and those in hell to them? Since it would not be good for those in heaven to be in hell, and the damned, hardened in malice, do not really want joy?

Understand this: the saints have a natural desire, a kind inclination, to help the miserable if it were possible. In this sense Abraham says that those here “want to go”—that is, they would like to bring help to those in hell. But God’s justice, which has fixed that chasm, has turned that desire in the saints toward agreement with itself. Therefore they cannot help them.

For example: a just judge catches his own brother or dear friend in a crime for which he could free him from death or punishment. He has a natural willingness and feels great pity. But because he loves God’s truth more than his friend, he condemns him and lets him suffer justice.

The damned, on the other hand, by their nature desire the highest good and eternal joy; but despair overcomes them so that they cannot humbly and willingly ask to receive it.

So when Abraham answers the rich man’s request that Lazarus come and cool his tongue with even a droplet on his fingertip, he shows that the saints grant no kind of help to those in hell.

Because Abraham’s answer completely cuts off the rich man’s hope of help there, he turns to another form of help, thinking he might be heard, and says: “Then, father, I beg you, send him to my father’s house; for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them”—that is, about eternal torments and eternal joy—“so that they also will not come into this place of torment.”

The rich man is not speaking out of love—which he did not have even when he was alive—but out of fear of greater torments. He knew that if his brothers, his companions in sin, came there, it would increase his pain.

So Saint Bede says that the rich man’s knowledge of the poor man he had despised, and his memory of his brothers he left behind, is preserved so that, seeing the joy of the one he despised and the torment of those he loved uselessly, he might suffer more.

Therefore Abraham denies his useless and unfitting request and says, “They have Moses and the prophets; let them listen to them.”

He would not send Lazarus back into the world to those to whom the rich man would not even go at his own door. The rich man asked unworthily. Abraham says, “They have Moses,” who wrote down the Ten Commandments for them, “and the prophets”—they have Isaiah, who, speaking for God, forbids walking in purple, forbids feasting every day, commands helping the needy and sharing bread with the hungry. They have Jeremiah, who forbids sexual immorality and forbids pride. “Let them listen to them.”

But because the rich man, when he was alive, did not care for God’s prophets or Moses’ commands—and believes his brothers will do the same—he says to Abraham, “No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.”

See, he confesses that his brothers do not listen to Moses and the prophets, but he thinks they would listen to someone who rose from the dead.

With these words he shows that he himself was like this, that he did not listen to Moses and the prophets, and that he had never experienced the torments of hell before.

So Abraham says, “If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets,” through whom God has spoken, “they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.” And so it was with Lazarus whom Christ raised: they not only did not believe him, but wanted to kill him (John 12:10).

And they did not want to believe Christ himself, who rose from the dead, but said that his body had been stolen. With this Christ signaled beforehand that those priests and scribes, to whom he was speaking, did not listen to Moses and the prophets, and yet they imagined that if someone rose from the dead, they would believe him.

Now, for our instruction, holy Gregory closes the reading this way:

“And you, dearest brothers, knowing both Lazarus’s rest and the rich man’s torment, act carefully. Seek intercessors for your sins and win for yourselves poor people who will speak for you on the day of judgment. For you have many Lazaruses now at your doors, who lie there and need the very things that fall from your tables after you are already satisfied.

The words of holy Scripture should teach you to fulfill the command of mercy—that is, to be merciful to the poor. Every day, if we look for Lazarus, we find him. Every day, even if we do not look, we see Lazarus. The poor urgently show themselves to us. Those who should be our advocates ask us. Truly, we ought to be the ones begging them to take from us, and yet they beg us.

See then, what answer will we give? What will we suffer, since those who beg are the heirs?”

So far Pope Saint Gregory—whom in this sermon today’s priests, rich people, and even popes hardly listen to at all. For which of them admits that they are only stewards, and that the poor are the heirs of what they hold? Which of them would rather beg the poor to receive from them than be begged to give?

Which of them seriously and diligently thinks about eternal torments, that he might escape them? Since they do not want to be good and merciful in order to escape them, Christ spoke this holy, great, beautiful, and deeply meaningful passage especially to the rich, to greedy priests and lawyers, and likewise to others.

Let the life of Lazarus and his reward be enough instruction for us—to be patient. And may God keep us from the misery of the rich man, so that we will not live as he lived, nor fall into the same torments. Instead, listening to Moses and the prophets, and so to our Savior, may we be freed from torment and set with Lazarus in joy.
