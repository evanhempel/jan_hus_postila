# First Sunday After Easter Night

In the Gospel of John, chapter 20, verses 19–31, we read:

“When it was evening on that same first day of the week, and the doors were locked where the disciples were gathered because they were afraid of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the middle of them and said, ‘Peace be with you.’ After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were filled with joy when they saw the Lord.

Jesus said to them again, ‘Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, I also send you.’ When he had said this, he breathed on them and said, ‘Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of anyone (in agreement with the will of God), they are forgiven them; if you keep them (in agreement with the will of God), they are kept.’

Now Thomas, one of the Twelve, called the Twin, who had long doubted in faith, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, ‘We have seen the Lord!’ But he said to them, ‘Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe.’

Eight days later, his disciples were again inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, though the doors were locked, stood in the middle of them, and said, ‘Peace be with you.’ Then he said to Thomas, ‘Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing.’ Thomas answered him, ‘My Lord and my God!’ Jesus said to him, ‘Because you have seen me with bodily eyes, Thomas, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen with bodily eyes and have believed.’

Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book. But these are written so that you may believe with living faith that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.”

This holy reading shows us Christ’s reasons, given for the benefit of the holy church, by which he proved to his disciples that he truly rose from the dead.

This appearance of Christ was the fifth one on Easter Day and the last one of that day, if we speak about his visible, bodily appearances written in Scripture. But we hold that to his beloved mother he first showed himself in an inward way. She had been the “treasury,” the “chest” of Christian faith on Good Friday and Holy Saturday. While almost all the others wavered, she kept faith.

Because she had guarded faith so faithfully, and because of his gratitude as a true Son to his mother, Christ first revealed to her his resurrection—not bodily to her eyes, but inwardly to her soul. And she received that revelation more firmly than the disciples did who later saw him with their eyes, yet still doubted.

So when Mark 16:9 says that he first appeared to Mary Magdalene, that is true about the first *bodily* appearance. Just as he later showed himself bodily to the disciples in this reading, which begins:

“When it was evening on that same first day of the week,” that is, the first day after the Jewish Sabbath, the day of Christ’s resurrection, “when the disciples were gathered together,” who earlier that day had scattered because they were afraid of the Jews, “and the doors were locked.”

The doors were locked, humanly speaking, because the disciples wanted to hide from the Jews. But in God’s plan they were locked so that the glory of Christ’s risen body would be shown: he entered through locked doors.

The disciples were deeply troubled—both by fear of the Jews and by grief over Christ’s death. So “Jesus came and stood in the middle of them, and said, ‘Peace be with you.’” With this greeting he comforted them: that they should not fear the Jews, that they should not be terrified by his sudden appearance, and that they might recognize him.

“And when he had said this,” to give them greater comfort and certainty, “he showed them his hands and his side,” so they would know it was truly he, in the same body in which he had promised them peace before his death, the same Lord and Master who had led them before.

To give them a strong proof, he showed them great signs: the hands with the wounds and the pierced side. Not that the wounds were still unhealed, but he left the marks there to show that it was the same body in every way, and also for other reasons already explained in other sermons.

“So the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord,” and their double sorrow, from fear and from grief, was turned into joy, “when they saw the Lord,” for whose death they had been so sad.

“Then he said to them again, ‘Peace be with you!’” Saying it a second time, he pointed them toward the future eternal peace. And immediately he showed them the path by which they must come to that everlasting peace. He said, “As the Father has sent me”—that is, to confess and to preach the truth—“so I also send you,” to confess and preach the same truth.

Because confessing and preaching the truth must be for the profit of both them and the people, they would need great help. So “he breathed on them and said to them, ‘Receive the Holy Spirit’”—that is, receive the gift of the Holy Spirit in power and in understanding.

By this breathing he teaches that the Holy Spirit and the gifts of the Holy Spirit come from him as well as from the Father. He did not breathe on them for no reason or as a playful child, but with deep divine purpose.

To this day bishops imitate that outward act when they ordain priests. They breathe toward them and say, “Receive the Holy Spirit.” But what they say does not happen instantly in the way they imagine. They do not have the power to *give* the Holy Spirit, as Saint Augustine proves in many places, saying that no one can give the Holy Spirit except God.

Christ, considered as a man, did not *originate* the Holy Spirit; he *received* the Spirit. That is why, when Christ said, “Receive the Holy Spirit,” Saint Augustine asks: How can Christ *not* be God, since he *gives* the Holy Spirit? As true God and the Son of the Father, Christ *gives* the Holy Spirit. As man, created, he *receives* the Holy Spirit.

Not so with the apostles or later priests. They do not give the Spirit. They may speak devoutly and ask the Lord God to give the Holy Spirit. They may lay hands on people, praying that God would give them the Spirit. But the power itself belongs to God alone.

If you say, “Then why doesn’t a priest instantly receive the Holy Spirit when the bishop breathes on him and says, ‘Receive the Holy Spirit’?”, I answer: first, because the bishop does not have the power to give the Spirit; second, because the man receiving ordination may be in mortal sin, which drives out the Holy Spirit and keeps him from entering a soul that clings to sin; third, because in our time many bishops live in mortal sins themselves—sexual immorality, pride, greed, and simony (buying and selling holy things). Such men are not worthy intercessors to obtain the Holy Spirit for others.

In the early church it was different. The holy apostles, as Luke writes in Acts 19:6, laid hands on people and prayed for them, and those people received the Holy Spirit so that they could preach, speak many languages, and work miracles. Good men prayed for good men; on both sides there was a right heart. So the gifts of the Spirit were poured out.

If now there were such people on both sides—holy ministers and sincerely repentant hearers—God would again give his gifts, so that his word would be preached boldly and the church would truly grow.

Still, it often happens, even now, that although a bishop is evil, the one who receives ordination from him with a sincere heart and according to the right order of the church does receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Not from that bishop, but from the higher One who truly consecrates his faithful servants—Christ himself. Just as when a bad priest baptizes or absolves: if the person comes with true good will, that person receives the Holy Spirit from Christ through the outward act of a bad priest.

Therefore, at Christ’s words, “Receive the Holy Spirit,” no one should rely on the bare sound of human speech, as if whenever a bishop or priest said those words, the people must at once receive the Holy Spirit. That power is reserved to God alone. To whomever *he* says, “Receive the Holy Spirit,” and intends it in fullness as with the apostles, that one truly receives the Spirit.

So when Christ said to his disciples and breathed on them, “Receive the Holy Spirit,” they received him at once.

Do not think that the breath of wind itself *was* the Holy Spirit, nor that the tongues of fire at Pentecost *were* the Holy Spirit, nor that the dove at Christ’s baptism *was* the Holy Spirit. All those were created signs. The Holy Spirit is not a creature, but the eternal God, who created those signs and who forgives sins.

For immediately Christ adds: “If you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven; if you keep them, they are kept.”

Here Saint Augustine says: It is the Holy Spirit who forgives; not you.

But priests today are greatly puffed up and swollen with pride by these words of Christ. They imagine that it lies fully in their own will: that if they choose to forgive someone’s sins, those sins are forgiven, and if they choose to keep them, they are kept.

Against such thinking Saint Jerome speaks on Christ’s words in Matthew 16:19: “I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”

Jerome says: Some, not understanding this, fall into the pride of the scribes of the Old Law, so that they think they can condemn the innocent and set free the guilty. Yet before God it is not the priest’s sentence that weighs, but the life of the sinner. In Leviticus 14 we read about lepers being commanded to show themselves to the priests. If the man had leprosy, the priest declared him unclean—not that the priest made him leprous or unclean, but the priest had the task to *recognize* who was leprous and who was not, who was clean and who unclean.

In the same way, the priest did not *make* the leper unclean; he only declared outwardly what was already true. So now, Jerome says, the bishop or priest binds and looses—not by making people guilty or innocent, but by his office, when he hears the different sins of people and discerns who should be bound and who loosed.

Up to here is Jerome’s teaching.

And a certain “master of deep meanings” adds that this shows clearly that God does not simply follow the priest’s judgment when it is based on error or lack of discernment. God always judges according to truth when he forgives or keeps sins.

So, if in the Old Testament the priests boasted falsely that they *healed* lepers, when in fact they only examined whether a man was healed or not, and if some claimed they had power to *make* people leprous, then they were boasting in lies.

In the same way, today’s priests have authority to examine a sinner, but they cannot cleanse a soul from sin or stain a soul that is not stained. If they claim they have the power to cleanse by their own forgiveness, or to stain and condemn by their own keeping, they boast falsely and grab at a power that belongs only to the Lord God.

He alone can, by his own power, bring a dead soul to life by grace and cleanse it from sin, just as he alone could create the soul in the first place.

Therefore Christ said to his disciples, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven.” That is, says Augustine: The Holy Spirit forgives, not you.

Elsewhere, preaching on John, homily 4, Augustine comments on the words of John the Baptist: “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.” Augustine warns: Let no one take this to himself or say that *he* takes away the sins of the world. Pay careful attention, he says, to whom John pointed with his finger. Heretics had not yet been born, and already they were condemned. Against them John cried out by the Jordan.

Augustine means this: When John pointed with his finger to Christ and said, “Look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world,” he was, by that word and gesture, condemning all heretics who would later claim that *they* had in themselves the power to forgive sins.

Thus Saint Augustine, that great teacher of Holy Scripture, shows that all those are heretics who boldly take to themselves and hold that anyone other than God forgives sins.

He also comments on Christ’s words about Mary Magdalene in Luke 7:48, “Her many sins are forgiven.” He argues that a person who is not God cannot forgive sins. Simon the Pharisee, thinking that a “mere man” (that is, one who is not God) cannot forgive sins, and thinking Christ was only a man, was still less evil than a heretic who says, “*I* forgive sins.”

Augustine says: The lawyer Simon was better—less evil. When he believed that Christ was only a man, he did not believe that sins could be forgiven by a mere man. In this, the Jews seemed to have a better understanding than the heretics. The Jews said, “Who is this who forgives sins? Can a man claim such a thing?” But what does the heretic say? “I forgive, I cleanse, I make holy.” You must answer such a one: “Not I, but Christ.” And Christ seems to respond to the heretic like this: “O man! When the Jews thought I was only a man, they did not believe that forgiveness of sins could come from me. I, when I was taken for a mere man, said to the sinful woman, ‘Go in peace, your faith has saved you.’ But you, being only a man, say to a woman, ‘Come here, woman, I will save you’?”

Then Augustine says that proud priests answer, not knowing what they say, as the apostle Paul puts it. They say, “If people do not forgive sins, then it is a lie that Christ said, ‘Whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.’ Do you not know why that was said? The Lord was going to give people the Holy Spirit, and from that Holy Spirit sins would be forgiven to his faithful. For what are you, O man, but a sick one who needs healing? Will you make yourself the doctor? No—seek healing together with me.”

To show more clearly that it is from the Holy Spirit, given to the disciples, that sins are forgiven—not by human merit—Christ says in one place, “Receive the Holy Spirit,” and immediately adds, “If you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven,” that is: The Holy Spirit forgives, not you.

All this is Augustine’s teaching, word for word, proving that no mere man can forgive sins unless he is also God, as Christ is.

To make this even clearer: There are different senses in which we can speak of “forgiving sins.”

First, someone may forgive sins by his *own* power, which he has from no one else. In this way, God alone—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—can forgive sins, and no one else. This is the highest kind of forgiveness.

Second, someone may forgive sins in the most excellent way by the power of his *merit*. In this way Christ, as man, the highest and most worthy priest, has a given authority from his divinity to forgive sins because he worked, suffered a cruel and shameful death for the sins of people, and in this way truly *earned* the power to forgive whom he wills. No other priest or man has this kind of power.

Third, someone may “forgive sins” in this sense: he hears the confession, understands the sinner’s intention and desire, and then declares to him that his sins are forgiven. He may say, for example, “Dear brother, if you truly grieve from your heart over your sins, if you do not want to sin anymore, and if you want to keep all God’s commandments, then I say to you that your sins are forgiven.” This third way is the priest’s role, according to the teaching of Augustine, Jerome, and the master of deep meanings.

So: God alone, by his *own* power, first and highest, forgives sins. Second, Christ as man, nearest to God, forgives sins through his suffering and merit to all who will be saved. Third and last, priests forgive sins when, with a *borrowed* authority, they judge and *announce* whose sins God has forgiven.

In the same threefold way sins are also *kept*. God keeps the sins of those to whom he does not wish to grant repentance. Christ keeps the sins of those whose guilt is not washed away by his passion because they refuse to believe and repent. Priests “keep” sins only in this sense: they must *announce* to people whose sins God still holds against them. For example: “Brother, you refuse to repent of adultery; the Lord God will not forgive you until you repent, and I cannot absolve you.”

From this you see: a person cannot be cleansed from sin except by God’s power and Christ’s merit. That is why Christ says to his disciples in John 15:5, “Without me you can do nothing.” So even if the pope, a bishop, or any other priest cries out to a person, “I forgive your sins; I free you from your sins and from all punishments,” yet if God does not forgive—and that only to one who *truly grieves* from the heart—nothing will save that soul.

Since a person cannot do anything good or even think anything good by himself, unless God gives it (2 Corinthians 3:5), neither pope nor anyone else can give a person true sorrow for sin. If they cannot give repentance, then they also cannot free him from sin or from the punishment due to sin.

There is yet a fourth kind of forgiving of sins, and every person has this authority: a man or woman can forgive the *offense* another has done against them, by refusing to take revenge and by letting go of bitter anger. Christ gave this power to all when he taught us to pray in the Our Father, Matthew 6:12: “Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.”

In this sense, some old grandmother has forgiven more sins to her neighbors than some pope, bishop, or priest perhaps ever has. And do not be shocked at this. The Virgin Mary herself, who died in old age, forgave more than the apostle Peter. She forgave all who were guilty of her Son’s death—who were more guilty against her than against Peter. Understand: she forgave those whom her Son also forgave; she did not forgive those whom he did not forgive.

Now you can understand Christ’s words, “If you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven him,” like this: When God forgives the penitent and the priest agrees with God, then the priest, in that sense, forgives—but not when the priest himself chooses or says, “I forgive,” as if his word alone made it so.

This is easy to see:

First example: Often a man confesses lying. He tells only small sins and purposely hides great ones. The priest, who cannot see the heart, pronounces absolution over him, and yet the man has only added more sin by his false confession.

Second example: No priest can ever know for certain, without special revelation, whether he has truly absolved anyone so that his sins are forgiven. The priest does not even know with certainty about himself whether he is in God’s grace, unless he is directly aware of some mortal sin. Scripture says, Ecclesiastes 9:1, “No one knows whether he is worthy of love or of hatred.” That is: no one knows, by his own light, whether he stands in favor or in wrath before God.

So that priests would not claim the power of *actually* forgiving sins as their own, Christ gave us an example. When he forgave the sins of the paralyzed man, and when he forgave Mary Magdalene and others, he did *not* say, “I forgive you your sins,” but, “Your sins are forgiven you”—that is, by God.

He did this to teach that others after him should speak the same way: “Take heart, son” or “daughter. Because you truly grieve over your sins and do not want to sin, your sins are forgiven you by God.” But they should *not* say, “I forgive you your sins,” for in speaking so, as Augustine says, they would fall into heresy.

Even if the penitent *does* receive forgiveness from God because of his true repentance, still the priest who says, “I forgive you your sins,” lies, for the forgiveness is God’s work, not his. And if the person does not repent, still holding onto his sins, and God does not forgive him, then again the priest lies if he says, “I forgive you your sins.”

So it is enough for a priest, when he sees outward signs of repentance and hears a man say he does not want to sin anymore, to say with *hope* but not with certainty, “Take heart, dear brother. The merciful Lord God has forgiven your sins.”

This is how the apostles and later saints spoke. They did not boast that they themselves forgave sins. But in our time many priests, especially the sexually immoral and the greedy, boast loudly that they forgive sins and can send whomever they want to heaven or to hell. They sell false indulgences and say in confession, “I give you forgiveness of sins and freedom from punishments.”

Blessed be the Lord God forever, who has not given them the power that they claim. If it were as they wish—if whoever they absolved were absolved, and whoever they condemned were damned—then they would absolve their concubines and send them to heaven, and they would throw into hell the righteous who speak against their immorality and greed. Indeed, anyone who refused to join them in their evil would immediately have his sins “kept” by them.

Then, for example, any honorable woman who refused a vile priest’s demand for adultery would be told, “I will send you to hell; I will keep your sins against you.” But God is opening the understanding of believers so that they are no longer fooled.

People are learning that a priest cannot absolve a sinner unless that man truly repents and God absolves him. And they are learning that a priest cannot keep anyone’s sins if God forgives them.

So even if all the priests shouted together that they “keep” my sins against me, yet if God himself forgave me, my sins would be forgiven and they would fail in their claim.

The same in the other direction. If they say, “We give you forgiveness of sins and take away your punishments,” and God says, “You do not repent of your sins; I do not forgive you,” then God’s word stands and their words are empty.

And this truth will be made plain to all on the Last Day, when lying priests who never repent will be put to shame for deceiving themselves and others. But faithful and humble priests who confess that they are unworthy servants of God, who say that they can do nothing except what God chooses to do through them, these will receive reward according to their faithfulness. It is to such disciples that Christ said, “If you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven; if you keep them, they are kept.”

Now the Gospel continues: “Thomas, one of the Twelve, called the Twin,” and so on.

In the Latin text he is called *didymus*. Some explain this as “doubting in faith,” because Thomas doubted Christ’s resurrection more than any other apostle. Others say *didymus* means “twin,” because he was from the tribe of Benjamin, where “twin” was a family name.

Both meanings can fit Thomas. In any case, he was not with the other disciples at this fifth appearance of Christ. Perhaps fear kept him away; perhaps he hid more strictly than the others. Or perhaps God, for Thomas’s greater good and for the benefit of the whole church, arranged it this way.

Good and useful things we love to share. So when the disciples had seen Jesus and Thomas later came in, they told him gladly, “We have seen the Lord.” But Thomas, doubting and unbelieving even toward them, shows his hardness of heart. He refuses to believe unless he can test with two senses—sight and touch—two wounds: the wounds in Christ’s hands and in his side.

Eight days later, at the sixth appearance, Jesus came again to the disciples, and Thomas was with them. As the All-knowing One, after greeting them with “Peace be with you,” he turned directly to Thomas and showed that he knew Thomas’s thoughts. For Thomas’s good and ours, he told him to put his finger into the wounds of his hands and to reach out his hand and put it into his side.

Do not think that Thomas hurt Christ again by touching those wounds or that he caused any new pain. In a fitting and painless way he touched the glorified body.

Saint Gregory says that Thomas’s unbelief has benefited our faith more than the faith of the other disciples. Because he was brought to faith by touching, we are freed from doubts and our faith is strengthened.

Then the gracious Savior gently rebukes Thomas, calling him to stop being unbelieving and to become believing. And Thomas, taught by seeing, hearing, and touching, confesses both Christ’s humanity and his divinity: “My Lord and my God!”

We should not imagine that Christ only taught him outwardly. The merciful Savior also taught and convinced him inwardly. As Thomas spoke with his mouth, he believed with his heart.

Notice that Thomas calls Christ not “Teacher” but “Lord,” although Christ had said earlier to the disciples (John 13:13), “You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am.” After rising from the dead, Christ no longer lived among them in the same way as a teacher at their side. He moved among them now as a mighty Lord, risen to immortal life and on the way to the Father.

Thomas calls him “God,” not because he saw the Godhead with bodily eyes or touched it with his hand, but because Christ gave him inward spiritual knowledge of his divinity. Augustine says, “Thomas saw and touched a man and confessed God.” Ambrose says, “He who had not believed put in his hand and found his Lord and God.”

For our comfort—since we have neither seen nor touched Christ with bodily senses—Christ adds, “Because you have seen me, Thomas, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.” Blessed are all who, without bodily sight, yet believe that Christ is Lord and God, almighty Lord and eternal God.

Here I ought to say more about this: how those who believe firmly without demanding signs are of good faith, and how those who refuse to believe without miracles are unbelieving. But I must end now and leave that for another sermon, for I have already spoken at length.

John ends this reading by saying that “Jesus did many other signs.” Why? “So that people might believe.” These that are written are enough, he says, “so that you may believe”—with living faith, not a faith killed by mortal sin—“that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have eternal life in his name.”
