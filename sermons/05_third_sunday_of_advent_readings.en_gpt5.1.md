### Reading For The Third Sunday In Advent  
St. Matthew, chapter 11, verses 2–10.

At that time, when John heard in chains about the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples and said to him (to Jesus): Are you the one who is to come [to redeem], or are we to wait for another? And Jesus answered and said to them (to John’s disciples): Go and report to John the things you have heard and seen: the blind see [being healed], the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor are being helped by the word of God [evangelisantur, that is: they hear the word of God and are helped by it]; and blessed is the one [that is] who does not stumble [through unbelief] over me. And when they departed, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind (that is, not a man whom pride or instability shook)? But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments [yet he goes about in a rough cloak]? Behold, those who wear soft [clothing] are in kings’ houses [as the proud and lovers of pleasure]. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Truly I say to you, more than a prophet; this is indeed the one of whom it is written [the prophet Malachi writes, 3:1]: Behold, I send my angel (that is, messenger: angelus in Greek, “messenger” in Czech) before your face, who will prepare your way before you.

In this reading there is first mention of the imprisonment of Saint John, the baptizer of Christ; second, of the wondrous works of our Lord Jesus Christ; third, A. of the praise of Saint John. About the imprisonment the reading says: “When John heard in chains about the works of Christ.” Know then that Saint John was in chains, in prison, because he rebuked King Herod for adultery, as Saint Matthew writes, 14:3–4, saying: Herod seized John, and bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother; for John kept saying to him: It is not lawful for you to have her. And Saint Mark says, 6:20: Herod was afraid of John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe; and when he heard him, he did many things, and he liked to listen to him. Why? Saint John Chrysostom explains this in a sermon about Saint John: John the Baptist used to speak what was according to the law, what was according to righteousness, what was for salvation; he surely spoke that which was not for hatred, but for love. Again he says: John was admonishing Herod with holy exhortations, not with accusation, as a lover of chastity, wanting him to be saved and not condemned. But because few leave fornication, therefore Herod, not wanting to leave his fornication and give up the adulterous mistress, put chains on John and cast him into prison; and he, being in chains, when he heard about the deeds of Christ, sent his disciples to him. Therefore the reading says: “When John, in chains, heard about the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples and said to him: Are you the one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?”

Know here that Saint John does not doubt whether Christ is the one who has come to take away the sins of the world; for earlier he confessed it, saying (John 1:29): “Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world!” He had recognized him even while still in his mother’s womb and rejoiced; and when he baptized him, he heard testimony from God the Father that this is his beloved Son, whom we are to hear. But Saint John asked out of concern for his disciples and for other people, so that they would not doubt Christ, but believe in him, listen to him, and finally follow him. For this reason he instructed his disciples to question Christ, saying: Are you the one who is to come as the promised Redeemer, or are we to wait for another?

And the reading continues: “And Jesus answered and said to them: Go and report to John the things you have heard and seen;” for as Saint Luke writes (7:21), at that very hour he healed many people of diseases, and plagues, and evil spirits, and to many who were blind he gave sight. And he answered and said to them: Go and tell John the things you have heard in the preaching, and seen in the wondrous deeds. On this Saint Ambrose says: The Lord prefers to answer by his deeds rather than by words. And Saint Jerome says: Let words be silent, let deeds speak. And thus the gracious Savior gave instruction, not to John, but to his disciples, that they should believe that he is the one they had been waiting for, who had come to take away sins and to deliver from condemnation. And to show that he is that one, after healing many he says: “The blind see,” and so on.

B. Know that by the blind are meant those who sin out of ignorance; by the lame, those who sometimes do evil and sometimes do good; by lepers, those who sin out of great desire; by the deaf, those who are hardened in wickedness; by the dead, those who sin out of long-standing habit. And all these now can be healed by the grace of our Savior, and many already have been healed, so that those who sinned out of ignorance now see, knowing what sin is and how they had been blind through sin; then the lame, who had lived sometimes badly, sometimes well, now live steadily in the good; and the lepers, defiled by sin through desire, are now cleansed; and the deaf, who had been careless toward the word of God, now gladly listen to it; and the dead, that is, those who had died in their souls through mortal sin and sinned out of habit, these now rise up from that habit. And in these five spiritual healings there is a greater miracle than in bodily healings, and a greater grace of God than in those. And then the beloved Savior set a sixth wonder, saying: “The poor are being helped by the word of God,” in Latin: evangelisantur, that is: they partake of the reading, which is the word of God, and in this way they benefit both themselves and others: they themselves hear and they teach others. “The poor,” understand this as the humble in spirit; these are helped by the word of God.

C. Know here that by the preaching of the word of God the mind is enlightened; secondly, desire is set in order; evil desire is quenched; hardness in evil is broken; sin is driven away; and the grace of God is brought forth in a person. From this you can know: whoever, out of these six benefits, feels none of them in himself when he hears the word of God, has a sign that he hears the word of God to no profit. About the blessed poor in spirit, to whom the Savior is sent to preach, he himself says through Isaiah (Isaiah 61:1–2; Luke 4:18–19): That I might proclaim good news to the meek, he has sent me, that I might heal the broken in heart, that I might proclaim release to captives, and opening of the prison to those who are bound, and that I might proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.

D. Further in the reading the Savior says: “And blessed is the one who does not stumble over me!” Know that people stumble over Christ in many ways. Some are offended at his mercy, saying that he does not avenge when he ought to avenge, or that he does avenge when he ought not. About the first they say, as Habakkuk 1:13: Why do you not look on those who do evil? that is, why do you not punish? About the second, that lazy servant said (Matthew 25:24): I knew you, that you are a harsh man! Some stumble at his wisdom, thinking that he does something he ought not to do; like those who rail against the weather, or those who imagine that they could have devised a better way than God has made; and so they marvel that it goes well for the wicked, saying Jeremiah’s word (Jeremiah 12:1): Why is the way of the wicked prosperous? that is, why do things go according to the will of the wicked? Some stumble because they do not want to suffer with him, as his disciples stumbled, to whom he said (Matthew 26:31): You will all fall away because of me! Some stumble at his poverty, as do priests generally, who do not want to be voluntarily poor; thus that young man stumbled, who went away from Christ sorrowful when he said to him (Matthew 19:21): Go, sell all that you have, and give to the poor, and come, follow me. Some stumble at his teaching, saying with the Jews (John 6:60): This is a hard saying; who can listen to it? And so all those stumble who do not keep his commandments, thinking them too hard. And, in general, people stumble over Christ, whoever does not believe him and in him, and whoever does not fulfill what he has commanded. Therefore blessed is the one who does not in the end stumble over him; for although many have stumbled, yet, returning again, by his grace they have amended their ways.

E. Then the reading says: “And when they departed, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?” As if he said: Do you suppose that John was like a reed, empty inside, not having in himself the grace of God? And do you think that he was shaken by flattery because he sent to me, or by inconstancy, because earlier he bore witness to me, saying (John 1:29): Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world! and now he says: Are you the one, or are we to wait for another? Know that he has not moved from his testimony, as a reed is moved before the wind. Here Saint Gregory speaks thus: As soon as the wind touches a reed, it bends it to one side. What is signified by the reed? Bodily desire alone, which, as soon as the wind of favor or of insult touches it, immediately bends to one side. For if the breeze of favor blows, it rejoices, boasts, and turns itself entirely toward favor; but if the breeze of insult blows from the same place where the wind of praise had come, then immediately it turns to anger. But John was not a reed shaken by the wind, for neither did the favor of praise make him a flatterer, nor did anyone’s anger make him cruel, nor did prosperous things lift him up in pride, nor did adverse things cast him down in virtue; therefore he was not a reed shaken by the wind, for no thing turned him away from the straightness of his state. Therefore, dearest, let us learn not to be reeds shaken by the wind; let us make firm our intention, which stands in the midst of the winds of tongues; let the state of our mind stand unmoved; let no insult stir us to anger, and let no unstable favor bend us toward favor, and let adverse things not so sadden us that we, who are set in the steadfastness of faith, should be moved by the unsteadiness of this world. This is Saint Gregory. Briefly understand it thus: do not let yourself be moved either by flattery into pride, or by insults into anger, or by prosperity into the sin of pride or pleasure, and do not let yourself be moved by adversities, such as poverty or other things, into impatience. If you remain so, then you will not be a reed shaken by the wind, and you will be worthy that Christ should praise you, as he praised Saint John.

F. Further Christ says: “But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments?” As if he said: John is no flatterer; for if he had wanted to flatter, he would not have lived in the wilderness, nor would he be sitting in a rough cloak in Herod’s prison. If he had wanted to flatter, then he would have flattered kings, not me the poor one; for those who want to go about in soft and fine clothing, those are in kings’ houses and flatter them. Oh, how many such flatterers there are, especially priests, at the courts of dukes, kings, and lords, and especially at the papal court! To him the greatest flatterers creep, and they bow down and worship him more than the Lord God. And they do all this so that they may go about in soft and costly garments, and bring forth pride, pleasure, and greed! Surely they have wandered very far from the life of John! And woe will it be to us, who do not want to suffer, but living softly wish to be saved! Woe to those who wear proud clothing for display, who have it cut in strange ways, who have much of it, of which as much or more is consumed by moths than by themselves! Against such people the apostle Saint James cries out (James 5:1–3): Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you! Your riches have rotted, and your garments are moth-eaten, your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire!
