This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon on John 3:16-21, focusing on God's love, human sinfulness, and the path to salvation. Hus emphasizes the depth of God's sacrifice, the contrast between light and darkness, and the consequences of unbelief.

### Key Points:
1. **God's Sacrificial Love**
   - "God so loved the world that he gave his only Son" (John 3:16)
     - This act was voluntary, not out of need, but pure grace.
     - The Son was given not to condemn but to save the elect.
   - Hus stresses the magnitude: God gave His *only* Son, not a servant or lesser being.

2. **Human Sinfulness**
   - People "loved darkness rather than light" (John 3:19)
     - Sin blinds and draws people away from God.
     - Evil deeds are done in secret to avoid exposure (John 3:20).
   - Hus warns that hidden sins will be revealed at judgment (Luke 12:2-3).

3. **Faith and Judgment**
   - "Whoever believes in him is not condemned" (John 3:18)
     - Faith means clinging to Christ with heartfelt love.
     - Unbelief leads to condemnation, not because of the name "Jesus" but rejecting the Son Himself.
   - The "judgment" is that light came, but many rejected it (John 3:19).

4. **Call to Repentance**
   - Those who "do what is true" come to the light (John 3:21)
     - Good works, done in God's grace, glorify Him.
   - Hus urges listeners to abandon sin and embrace eternal life.
