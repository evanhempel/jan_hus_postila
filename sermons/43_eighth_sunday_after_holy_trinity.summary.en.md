title: Eighth Sunday After Holy Trinity
---

This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon for the Eighth Sunday after Holy Trinity, focusing on Matthew chapter 7, verses 15-21. The sermon warns against false prophets and emphasizes the importance of discerning true faith through actions.

**Key Points**
- **False Prophets**: Jan Hus warns of false prophets who appear righteous but are inwardly corrupt, likened to wolves in sheep's clothing.
- **Fruit of Actions**: True faith is revealed through good deeds, while evil actions expose false teachers.
- **Judgment**: Those who do not bear good fruit will be cut off and cast into eternal fire.
- **True Faith**: Simply calling "Lord, Lord" is not enough; one must do the will of the Father in heaven.
- **Hypocrisy**: Many falsely claim righteousness, using Christian titles and rituals, but their actions betray their true nature.

**Key Quote**
> "Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven." (Matthew 7:21)
