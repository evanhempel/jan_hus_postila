SECOND SUNDAY AFTER HOLY TRINITY.  
St. Luke, chapter 14, verses 16–24.

At that time Jesus our Lord and Savior said this parable: “A certain man [Christ] made a great supper (that is, in particular he prepared eternal joy), and he invited [by inward enlightenment] many [all people]. And he sent his servant [that is, the company of preachers] at the hour of supper (that is, at the time of the incarnation of the Son of God) to say to the invited that they should come (leaving their sins and clothing themselves in the garment of virtue), because all things are ready (without lack) [for Christ has already been offered, and thus all things are ready for eternal joy]. And they all alike began to make excuses (that is, those who love earthly things more than heavenly joy); the first said, ‘I have bought a field (that is, I have found pride), and I must (being constrained by desire) go out (that is, from the way of God) and see it; I beg you, have me excused (that is, excuse me, pray to God for me, for I am a sinful man).’ And another (that is, the miser) said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them; I pray you, have me excused.’ And another (the fornicator) said, ‘I have taken a wife (that is, I have consented to fornication), and therefore I cannot come’ (being constrained by evil desire). And the servant returned (that is, came back to the supper from his labor) and told his lord all these things (that is, the excuses and hardness of those who were invited). Then the householder became angry (Christ, that they do not want to come to such a supper), and said [by inward instruction] to his servant, ‘Go out quickly (that is, without delay go and preach) into the streets [where the common people are] and lanes of the city (that is, of this world), and bring in here the poor (that is, those despised in the world), and the weak [in understanding], the blind (blinded by sin), and the lame (slothful, and those who want to be good and yet are evil together) (that is, into my house, to the supper).’ And the servant said, ‘Lord, it has been done as you commanded [that is, I have brought them], and still there is room (that is, room into which they may come).’ And the lord said to the servant, ‘Go out into the roads and hedges (that is, wherever you can), and compel (with terrors and with power) them to come in, so that my house may be filled (that is, the number of the elect in heavenly joy). For I tell you [I, who cannot fail], none of those men who were invited (hear this: and in the end did not want to accept) shall taste of my supper (of heavenly joy).’”

A. In this holy reading the Savior shows his generosity and diligence, and human ingratitude: his generosity, in that he made a great supper; his diligence, in that he sent his servant three times to call those invited to the feast, that is, to that great supper; and their ingratitude, in that they all made excuses and did not want to come to that supper. But the word at the end is dreadful, that he says, he who cannot fail: “I tell you, that none of those men who were invited shall taste my supper.”

At the beginning the Savior says: “A certain man,” know that this is Christ, who is in a unique way one man above all others, “made,” that is, prepared as God, “a great supper,” that is, eternal joy for all the elect who will feast at his table forever. This eternal joy is called a “supper,” first, because as after the supper of a day there is no more dinner that day, so after that joy there will be no other joy, as St. Gregory says. Second, because as at supper it is fitting to eat more delicate food than at dinner, so that a person is not burdened; and because in that joy there will be the most delightful satisfaction, without any burden, therefore it is also called a supper. And third, because at supper one remains only with the dearest ones, and not so at dinner; and because in heavenly joy only those who are very dear will remain, and the ungrateful will not taste that supper, as the reading says at the end, therefore it is also called a supper. And it is called “great” because of the greatness of the lord who prepared it. For who could be greater, to invite to a supper, than Christ, true God and true man, who is king and lord of the whole world, most mighty, most wise, best, most beautiful, most generous, and thus most delightful to those he invites? Therefore it is rightly a great supper, on account of so great a lord.

Second, the supper is called great because of the greatness of the guests who will be at that supper; for there will be holy angels, and only kings and queens. And there will be many of them, for the prophet Daniel says, 7:10: “Thousands of thousands serve him, and ten times ten thousand times a hundred thousand stand with him.” And should that not be called a great supper, since there will be so many and such great banqueters? And do not let it disturb you that Christ says, Matthew 22:14: “Many are invited, but not many are chosen.” For he means that in comparison to all those who are invited, those who are chosen for salvation are not many; for there are far more invited than chosen.

Third, the supper is called great because of the great preparation, of which St. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 2, that “eye has not seen, ear has not heard, nor has it entered the heart of man,” that is, so that one could fully know here, “the things which the Lord God has prepared for those who love him.” And what more can be thought of than the satisfaction of the will without lack? And that satisfaction is ready for every elect person who with all desire draws toward that supper.

Fourth, it is a great supper because of its eternity, that is, because it does not end. See how great the supper is!

From these reasons we can know the generosity and also the freedom of that man who made the great supper, and not in vain, but so that it might be enjoyed. Therefore he says further: “And he invited many,” for he called many, that is, all, both the elect and those foreknown [as reprobate]; for he calls all by inward enlightenment, by which he has enlightened every person so that by nature he desires heavenly joy. And beyond that he calls some by special gifts, some by sufferings, labors, and other trials, and he calls through his Scripture by holy prophets. And beyond that he sent his servant, that is, the company of preachers, such as the apostles and their other deputies, who are called “servant” as if one; for they are to invite those called to one supper, by the command of one Lord and with one intention, to the supper at the hour of supper.

The hour of supper can be called the time of the incarnation of the Son of God, at which time the sweetness of blessedness, that is, of heavenly joy, is prepared more fully and the supper is desired more joyfully. And this the servants are to say to those invited to the supper: that they should come, preparing themselves, leaving sins and clothing themselves in the garment of virtue; for all things are ready without lack. St. Gregory says: “All things are already prepared; for because Christ has been offered, entrance into the kingdom is ready.” Alas for him who, having a good road and everything prepared, does not want to go to that supper! Why does he not consider that “a certain man,” that is, Christ, mighty God and gentle, so more gracious and generous than others, “has made,” because he is mighty and good, “a great supper,” that is, eternal joy, showing his generosity? That “one man,” who gave himself to sinners for redemption from sin, from the devil, and from eternal damnation; that “one man,” who gave himself as food for the sick for strengthening, for prisoners for deliverance, and who gives himself for eternal consolation; that man has made a great supper, that is, eternal joy, which consists in the knowledge of the holy Trinity, and in love, and in being satisfied in those two things, such that a person, knowing God and thus the holy Trinity and all things in it, will then love God with full will, and in that will be so satisfied in joy that from it he will not be able to be moved anywhere.

Having made that supper, the man Christ called many; but not many have come, that is, will come. St. Gregory says *In om.*: “He called many, but not many come; for even those who are outwardly subject to him by faith oppose his eternal supper by living badly, that is, they do not want to go to it.”

Therefore Christ says further: “And they all alike began,” that is, those who love earthly things more than heavenly joy, “to make excuses.” The explanation says: Each one makes excuses who loves earthly things more than heavenly things, even if he says that he intends to go to heavenly joy. Therefore Christ says that “they all began to make excuses,” that is, to refuse to do what would lead them there, although no one, while he lives here, says: “I do not want to go to eternal joy.”

And of these excuse‑makers “the first said, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it; I pray you, have me excused.’” This one represents every proud person who, having goods, is proud because of them; for St. Augustine says that in that bought field lordship and pride are signified. Therefore when he says, “I have bought a field,” Augustine says: that is, I have found pride. And thus that first man represents all the proud, who all delay going to the supper, each one by his evil deed contradicting that he should go. Therefore the first says, “I have bought a field,” that is, I have delighted myself in pride, for which I have given both my soul and the great supper, “and I must,” being constrained by my desire, “go out” from the way of God and see it. For pride greatly consists in seeing, so that the proud man desires to be seen by people above others. “I pray you,” servant of the Lord, “have me excused,” that is, excuse me. The exposition says: Pray for me, for I am a sinful man. St. Gregory says: “Humility is on the lips, but because he refuses to come, there is pride in the excuse.” And indeed each evil person judges or understands this when he hears it; however, understanding that what he does is evil, he does not abandon it. For when we say to every evil person: Turn back, follow God, leave the world, and so we call him to the Lord’s supper, yet when he answers, “Pray for me, I cannot do that,” what else does he do but make excuses and ask? So far St. Gregory.

“And another said: ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them; therefore I pray you, have me excused.’” This second represents all misers, who are burdened with the yoke of greed, having harnessed the five bodily senses, bending them toward the goods of this world. Their yoke is the devil’s and the world’s binding of them, so that the devil and the world have burdened and yoked them, to draw according to their will. Therefore this one says: “I am going,” that is, being pricked by the devil’s goad, “to test them.” Fool! Having already bought them, now you want to test them; just as the first fool, who having bought the field, then wanted to go out to see it! And he says the same as the first: “Have me excused.” For these two sins, pride and greed, have many hidden and clever excuses. For people cannot so quickly recognize when they sin by pride or greed as they can recognize fornication; for whenever anyone desires another man’s wife, that is, not his own, to the act outside of marriage, then at once he has committed adultery with her in his heart and has sinned mortally. Therefore the third does not make excuses at once, who represents fornicators. Of him Christ says: “And another said, ‘I have taken a wife, and therefore I cannot come.’ He has taken a wife who has consented to fornication, and so he cannot come. He put forward no excuse except this, that he cannot come to the supper because he has taken a wife. St. Gregory says: “What is signified by the wife but bodily pleasure? For although marriage is good for offspring, established by God’s wisdom, yet many through it seek not offspring but the fulfillment of fleshly desire.” So far Gregory. Therefore this man does not represent holy spouses, but every fornicator and every harlot who love fornication more than the kingdom of heaven.

And truly I have heard both from priests and from lay people that they have groaned, saying that they cannot be without the act of fornication, even if they were to be damned forever. Poor blind and brutish creatures, led astray by the devil! For the sake of brief lust they want to lose eternal joy and fall into eternal damnation! And surely many men and women will be damned for shameful fornication.

Christ says further: “And the servant returned and told his lord all these things.” “The servant returned,” that is, came to the supper from his labor, “and told all these things,” that is, the excuses and hardness of those who were invited. For many who call others to that supper, seeing that they do not want to go, return from their labor to prayer and complain to God that the invited do not want to go to the supper; and not only they speak to the Lord, but both their labors and those excuses testify before the Lord that they do not want to come—not that he would not know it, but that those evil ones may know that both their sin and their excuses accuse them.

He goes on: “Then the householder became angry,” that is, Christ, because they do not want to come to so great a supper, “and said” by inward instruction “to his servant: ‘Go out quickly,’ that is, without delay go preach to the common people, ‘go out into the streets and lanes of the city,’ that is, of this world, ‘and bring in the poor,’ who though somewhat capable in mind and having no goods, yet will rather come to the supper than others, ‘and the weak,’ that is, those who by their natural disposition are of weak wit, ‘and the blind,’ that is, those who by the devil’s teaching are blinded in spiritual matters, ‘and the lame,’ that is, those who because of sloth do not walk in God’s way, ‘bring them here,’ that is, into my house, to the supper.”

We should also notice, as Christ’s speech implies, that the rich, who own fields, and the strong, who plow with oxen, and the fornicators, commonly rich, being satisfied with pride, greed, and fornication, do not care for eternal joy; therefore God commands that the poor, weak, blind, and lame be called; for they, not having such cause for sin, will more readily come to the supper.

But spiritually poor are those who do not have God’s grace and virtue; and they are also weak, for being without grace, they cannot do any good for their salvation; they are also inwardly blind, because, being blinded by wickedness, they do not know God rightly; they are also lame, because they do not have true inward desires toward God and good works; for though by nature they desire the eternal joy of the supper, yet they quickly will not leave sins. And all these the servant, that is, the preacher, must call, and lead them by good example and by God’s word into the kingdom of Christ, to the supper.

He says further: “And the servant said: ‘Lord, it has been done as you commanded, and still there is room,’ that is, room into which the invited can enter. ‘And the lord said to the servant: Go out into the roads and hedges.’” With this word the Savior shows that wherever his faithful servant could call people to the supper, he should do it; and he clearly commanded this when he said in Matthew 16: “Going into all the world, preach the Gospel to every creature.” And they, having gone, preached everywhere, that is, wherever people wanted to hear them.

But alas! pride, greed, and envy have now bound this road of preaching, so that God’s word no longer has the freedom it once had; for now Antichrist stretches out his nets and narrows Christ’s. To Peter Christ had commanded to spread the nets for fish, of which he caught many. And because that catch signified the catching of souls with the net of God’s word, he said to him right after that that from then on he would catch men; and he did indeed catch widely, and so did the other holy apostles. But the apostles of today’s Antichrist, if someone wishes faithfully to call people to the supper according to God’s command, immediately are angry and do not allow him to call, unless he wants to preach according to their will, praise them, and not touch their sins.

And from this Antichrist’s gun the priests, together with the archbishop of Prague, priest Zbyněk, have gotten a bull, that is, a letter with a leaden seal, which commanded that God’s word not be preached anywhere except in parish churches and monasteries and their cemeteries. And against that bull the Lord God gave me the desire to stand, and, because of today’s Gospel reading, not to obey the command of that bull. And I preached with his help even to the point of excommunication and being suspended from the (false) ministry, and I still preach, and I will, if his holy grace allows, preach, whether I might be able to lead some poor, weak, blind, or lame soul into Christ’s house, to the supper. Before, I preached in towns and in their streets, but now I preach among the hedges, near the castle called Kozí, between the roads of towns and villages; for Christ says: “Go out to the roads and hedges,” understand there: among the hedges, “and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.” He says: “compel,” that is, with terrors of eternal torments, “to come in,” that is, to go, “that my house may be filled,” that is, that the number of the elect in heavenly joy may be fulfilled. “For I tell you,” I, who cannot fail, “that none of those men who were invited” (hear this: and in the end did not want to come) “shall taste,” not merely will they not eat their fill, but “shall not even taste my supper,” that is, heavenly joy. Alas for the proud, the greedy, and the fornicators, who so make excuses! And alas most of all for him who is called a servant, to call others to the supper, and then himself, through pride, greed, and fornication, removes himself from the supper, and, having to call others, does not call, but hinders those who call!

Now the generosity of Christ has been shown in the great supper, and his great diligence in the threefold sending of the servant, and human ingratitude, in that they did not want to come to such a great, generous, and gracious Lord, to so great a supper. We also have in this reading three kinds of people called to the supper: First are those who, being invited, did not want to come. Second are those who came willingly; these were the poor, weak, blind, and lame, whom the servant brought in as the Lord had commanded. Third are those who came without their own will, of whom he said: “Compel them to come in;” for if they could not enter unless compelled, then the Lord would not have commanded to compel them, so that his house might be filled.

Therefore there is this question: Since the Lord commands to compel them to go to the supper, is it fitting for a secular lord to compel, so that confused people should go to that supper? And at first it seems not, first because the secular lord does not have spiritual power to compel to that supper. Second, because no one turns to God except freely, and so this unfree going to the supper will not benefit those who are compelled. Third, because coming to that supper ought to be, and is, pleasant and thus voluntary, and every compulsion is unpleasant and thus contrary to the will—how then can that compulsion be both voluntary and involuntary? Fourth, because freedom has been given to every person for good and for evil; how then can that freedom stand together with the involuntary compulsion?

On this question one thing is certain: that it is fitting for secular lords—kings, princes, nobles, knights, squires, and townsmen—according to order and from love, to compel confused people to go to that final supper; for they have from God lordship, power, and the sword for that, as St. Paul proves in Romans 13:1–4, saying: “Every soul [that is, every person] be subject to the higher powers; for there is no power except from God, and the things that are from God are ordained. Therefore whoever resists the power [when it is exercised according to order] resists the ordinance of God; and those who resist will receive condemnation for themselves. For princes are not [appointed] for fear of good work, but of evil work. Therefore if you do not want to fear the power, do good, and you will have praise from it; for he [the lord] is God’s servant to you for good [so that you may be good]. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God’s servant, an avenger, in wrath on him who does evil.” All this is St. Paul, clearly proving that every person is to be subject to the higher power of the secular hand, and that therefore the prince or lord bears the sword, so that in order and for God’s praise he may mightily avenge evil‑doers and compel them to keep God’s law, and thus to the final supper, and that he may protect the good.

To the same end St. Peter says in the second chapter of his first epistle: “Be subject to every human creature [that is, to every person] for the Lord’s sake: whether to the king, as supreme, or to governors, as sent by him for the punishment of evil‑doers and the praise of those who do good.” And so from that word of Christ in the reading, “Compel, that is, make them come in, that they may go,” and from the Scripture of his two apostles, and from many other Scriptures, we have that a king, prince, or lord is God’s servant, having lordship, power, and sword to defend the good and to compel the evil, whether they be lay or clerical; for both must be subject to the higher powers. But from this Scripture Antichrist wants to exempt his clergy by his own ordinances, so that now they want that even if a priest lives in whatever evil way, a secular lord should have nothing to do with him, neither punish him, nor lay a hand on him. But the humble Jesus said to the Jewish multitudes, John 8:46: “Which of you will convict me of sin?” And Antichrist says in return: “None of you convict me of sin!” The humble Paul and Peter and others walk after Christ, but the proud walk after Antichrist.

To the first argument, which says: The secular lord has no spiritual power to compel to that supper—I deny that consequence; for the lord therefore has revenues and lordship, to restrain the evil by power and to protect the good. And we have an example of this in the Old Testament, in the third book of Kings, chapter 2, verses 26–27 and 35, that King Solomon removed the high priest Abiathar from the bishopric and the priesthood and sent him to his field, and in his place put Zadok the priest.

To the second argument, when it is said: no one turns to God except freely—know this: that sometimes something is at the beginning against the will and afterwards with the will, as when a maiden is sometimes unwillingly given in marriage, wanting to have another man; yet when her father compels her, it happens that afterward she gladly and thus freely lives with him. And so her first going to that man was in one way involuntary, but afterward it is beneficial to her both for offspring and other things. So here: at first a person is displeased that he is compelled to leave dice, adultery, or other sin, and afterward he will be glad of it, that he has been turned away, and so he will benefit himself for the eternal supper.

And from this you have at once the answer to the third argument, which says that going to the supper at the beginning by compulsion is not pleasant; but afterward, when a person understands his own good, it will be voluntary and thus pleasant. You already have the example given of the maiden. Here is another: A merchant in a ship at sea, having much merchandise that weighs down the ship and so draws it toward sinking, when he sees this, throws out the goods rather than drown with them; and so throwing out the goods is in one way unpleasant, yet for the preservation of life that throwing out is voluntary. And so although the beginning is unpleasant, yet the end is pleasant. From this you have further that the same deed can be called both voluntary and involuntary, but in different respects: involuntary in the beginning, voluntary in the end. Just as throwing the goods into the sea is in some way involuntary, for a person would rather not cast them into the sea; yet it is also voluntary, for he would rather throw them into the sea than drown with them. So too compulsion to the eternal supper is at the beginning, for the one who is compelled, involuntary and unpleasant, but in the end it becomes pleasant; as for a sick man, medicine is unpleasant when the physician sews a wound or cuts off a limb, but when he is healthy, then that is very welcome to him.

To the fourth argument I say that the will is always free, so that no one, except God, can so compel it that a person should will something if he himself does not want to; and thus the freedom of the will stands, even if someone at times moves it by compulsion so that he chooses rather with that compulsion than without it.

And so now you have that it is fitting for secular lords by power to compel the evil so that they may become good; and it is fitting for priests, not so much by power, but by good admonition, to lead the people to the supper. And to both Christ in this Gospel has now given instruction: he commands the priest to call, and the lord to compel; he has also given them an example: to priests he commands humbly, and to lords, as king, when he drove the sellers from the temple with a whip, and when by his word he cast down the Jewish multitudes in his arrest, and when he cast down Saul, that is, St. Paul, on the way, as he went to seize his servants.
