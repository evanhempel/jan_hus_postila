FIFTEENTH SUNDAY AFTER THE HOLY TRINITY.  
St Matthew, chapter 6, verses 24–33.

At that time Jesus said: No one can serve two masters (who are opposed to each other in their rule); for either he will hate the one (the devil) and love the other (God), or he will put up with the one (the devil) and despise the other (God). You cannot serve God and money (mammonae, worldly goods). Therefore I say to you, do not be anxious about your soul (that is, your life), what you will eat, nor about your body, what you will put on; surely your soul is more (that is, of greater worth) than food, and your body more (more honorable) than clothing. Look at the birds of the air, that they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns, and your heavenly Father feeds them; are you not worth much more than they (that is: in value—are you not much more precious than the birds)? And which of you by thinking can (as if he had said: none of you can) add one cubit to his height? And why are you anxious about clothing (in a disordered way)? Consider the lilies of the field (that is, the various flowers), how they grow (to their adornment); they do not toil, nor spin; yet I tell you that even Solomon (a mighty, wise, and rich king) in all his splendor (royal glory) was not clothed (so beautifully in brightness) like one (single flower) of these. For if God so clothes (that is, adorns) the grass of the field, which exists today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more (surely cloth) you, you of little faith (that is, you who are of little faith, if you have disordered anxiety)? Therefore (that is, since this is so) do not be anxious, saying: What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed? For all these things the pagans (who have no faith) seek. Your Father (in heaven) certainly knows that you need all these things; therefore (believing and trusting in him that he will not forsake you) seek first (be especially diligent to seek) the kingdom of God (that is, the heavenly joy) and his righteousness (that is, every kind of virtue that leads to the heavenly kingdom), and all these things (that is, the things needed for life) will be added to you (according to measure).

A. The merciful Savior, by this holy teaching, draws his faithful away from evil love of earthly things, and draws them to the love of heavenly things: first he commands them not to serve riches; second, not to give themselves with disordered diligence to bodily things; third, to trust in the heavenly Father and to seek first the heavenly kingdom. And although the Savior has spoken this holy and useful command very well for our salvation, yet St Luke writes (16:14) that when the lawyers, who were greedy, heard it, they mocked him. There St Bede says: Christ had first already warned the teachers and lawyers not to trust in their own righteousness, but to receive sinners who repented, and to redeem their sins with alms; and they in turn held the one who commanded mercy, humility, and sobriety in derision! Therefore St Luke says that when the lawyers, who were greedy, heard this, they mocked him, and that for two reasons: first, that he was, in their eyes, commanding things very useless; or second, that he was commanding them in vain, since they had already done everything. So speaks St Bede. And as the estate of masters, priests, and lawyers runs now, it does not differ from those men; for this same reading is in derision among them now as it was among those then. And now they make Christ an even greater mock than they did; for they at least openly rejected his words, but these do it under disguise; for some say that they keep them, while others by deed and by word oppose him, and both kiss him at Mass, yet do not leave greed. And so they are Christ’s disciples and Judas’s followers, who heard this reading from Christ, and for greed betrayed Christ with a kiss. But not so Peter and the other apostles and their followers, who, having cast away lordship and greed, when they had something to eat and drink and a fitting garment for work, were content with that; they obeyed Christ in this reading, for they first sought the kingdom of heaven, lived well themselves, and taught others to do the same; and so they served most of all one Lord, God, who says: “No one can serve two masters.”

B. Know here that Christ means two masters who are opposed to each other in lordship, and a proper kind of serving, so that no one can at the same time properly serve two masters who are opposed. For, as Christ gives the example, saying, “You cannot serve God and money,” it is known even to the dullest reasonable person that a person cannot at the same time rightly and reasonably incline his desire both toward God and toward money; rather it must be that he is more inclined in his desire with consent either toward God than toward money, or more toward money than toward God. And where he is more inclined with his consenting desire, there his service turns; and so if the greater desire with consent is toward God, then the service is God’s, and not that of money; but if the greater desire is toward money than toward God—and so than toward salvation—then the person serves money and not God. And so, by the intention of desire, Christ weighs that service when he says: “Do not be anxious about your soul, what you will eat;” and there he forbids excessive desire. And when he says: “Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness,” there he commands that they have their greatest desire toward God, who is the kingdom of the elect, and toward the righteousness of the kingdom, that is, toward every virtue which leads into the heavenly kingdom. Therefore, whoever wants to know about himself whom he serves most, let him turn his mind and weigh where his diligence is chiefly turned, and he will at once know whom he serves most. For example: if Peter has two masters and is with eager diligence more desirous to serve John than Přibík, then Peter serves John more than Přibík. Likewise, if Peter has two beloved women, Catherine and Margaret, and he is more eagerly desirous of Catherine than of Margaret, then he loves Catherine more than Margaret. Now, greedy man, judge: where your desire with diligence is more turned, there too is your service.

And since it is not fitting that anyone could rightly be more, or equally, inclined in his desire toward some creature than toward God—for so at once he would value God less in his desire than the creature, and thus would despise him and hold him in hatred—it is therefore impossible to serve God and money rightly at the same time. Therefore the Savior says: “You cannot serve God and money.” And in beginning the reading he says thus: “No one can,” that is, rightly, properly, or with loving desire, “serve two masters,” that is, masters who are opposed in their lordship. And know that there are two masters opposed, which draw human desire this way and that. And so God and the devil are two opposing masters, contrary and at odds; for God, being the true Lord of the whole world, because he created and sustains it, is in particular the Lord of mankind, because he created humans, and by his own blood redeemed them, and feeds them, and gives them the heavenly kingdom, if they will serve him rightly; and so he alone is Lord over all other lords. But the devil is not truly a lord, except as a robber; for, having no rightful claim over a person that he might properly rule him, by malice he drags under himself whomever he can; and he is also called king over all the sons of pride, as St Job says in chapter 40. And Christ says that he is the prince of this world, that is, of evil people in this world.

C. Now, if you are eager to serve some little master so that you may fill your belly and have a worn coat, you carefully inquire after him, and when you come to him you ask what you must do in his service; and that little master cannot give you anything without the will of the great Lord! Ah dear brother! be diligent toward the best Lord, the most powerful, the richest, and the most generous: the best, who cannot do injustice nor be angry without cause; the most powerful, whom no one can overcome, and who can protect his servant against every enemy; the richest, who has all things in his power; and the most generous, beyond whom no one can give more bountifully to his servant for his service; for he gives his servant his heavenly kingdom and full joy, beyond which nothing more can rightly be desired. O dear brother! to this Lord you committed yourself at baptism; therefore serve him diligently; for he created you, redeemed you with his blood, he feeds you, he defends you from the devil, he feeds you with his body, gives you drink with his blood, he forgives the sins of the one who is turned back to him, enriches with virtues, strengthens in good, helps to accomplish good, gladdens the heart, and where he himself is, there he wants his servant finally to be. And so he is the most faithful and best Lord, to serve whom, says St Gregory, is to reign.

Who, then, accursed, does not want to be diligent to serve that Lord, whose service is very light, namely this: to love that Lord above all and one’s neighbor? That service includes this: that a person does not choose sin, and loves the good. And that service is light because a person can fulfill it for his reward even in the open air, on the sea, in prison, in stocks, in poverty, in sickness, in nakedness; indeed, as long as one soul is in the body, so long a person can render that service to God, and for it receive the eternal kingdom, which is a filling of joy without lack. Alas for people, that they do not care for the service of that Lord, but serve rather another lord opposed to him—the devil—the most wretched, the worst, the poorest, the most cruel, who makes his servants shameful and vile, robs them of virtue, weakens them in good, leads them into evil and strengthens them in it, kills the soul, and then for ever torments them in darkness and in fire! These, then, are the two masters opposed in lordship, whom it is impossible to serve at the same time. Therefore they are deceived who, not keeping God’s commandments, think that they are serving him with fasts, alms, prayers, or other works, and at the same time by mortal sin serve the devil; for the Lord, who cannot fail, says that “no one can serve two masters.” He “cannot” in a proper, desiring way at one and the same time “serve two masters” opposed in their rule; for “either he will hate the one,” that is, the devil, “and love the other,” that is, God; “or he will put up with the one,” that is, the devil—St Luke in 16:13 says: he will cling to the one, and both are well said; for although the sinner does not say that he loves the devil more than God, yet he puts up with him ruling over him in evil, as this reading says, and by sin he clings to him, as St Luke says—“and despise the other,” that is, God; for everyone who sins mortally, rejecting God’s commandment, sins in pride and despises God. St Augustine says thus in a sermon, In omel: “He will despise,” he says, and does not say, “he will hate;” for no conscience is able to endure actually hating God. And to despise him, that is, not to fear him, is what whoever does not keep his commandments does. So Augustine.

D. Further the Savior says, himself giving the explanation: “You cannot serve God and money.” The explanation is this: To serve wealth is to deny God. And know that in the Latin text it stands: mammonae. St Jerome says that in the Syrian tongue mammona means wealth, and also Mammon is a devil, that one who by wealth leads people into sin. And it seems to me that here I ought to have put in the reading: “You cannot serve God and mammonae, that is, wealth.” And this is shown from Christ’s words, for he at once adds: “Therefore I say to you, do not be anxious about your soul,” that is, about your life, “what you will eat.” And so he touches on food and clothing, the two things in which all wealth useful to a person consists; for when a person is full and warm, he ought to be content. And since the Savior forbids disordered excess in these two things—food and clothing, the most needful to a person—how much more in the other things!

E. And so that the reading may be better understood, know that there is a threefold service. First, there is natural service, by which every creature must serve God, whether it wishes to or not. Second, there is loving service, by which every person ought to serve everyone; and this he does when, being in God’s grace and serving God by good works, he serves also the angels and all the saints: those in heaven, those delivered from hell, and those here on earth. Third, there is human service, that is, service invented by people, and that is often disordered; and people now for the most part devote themselves altogether to that service. And that service is brought in by a threefold custom: first, by conquest, when some force others under their service; second, it is brought in by free will, when one person freely submits himself to another’s service for bodily payment; third, service is brought in by a person’s lack of fitness, so that by his coarse nature he is more fitted for labor and work than another. And this reason is the most likely, that such a person should serve others more fit and more capable, who surpass others both in bodily fitness and in understanding. For the wise man Aristotle says that people who are well endowed in sense and reason are by nature lords and rulers over others.

F. Second, know that there is one kind of care that is good, and another that is evil. Good care again is twofold. First, that by which a person with desire and diligence looks toward God, toward virtues, and toward spiritual deeds; and that care befits the God‑minded life, which others call the spiritual life. And this care the apostles and their followers had. The second good care is a mixed care, which a person has in the working life, looking first to God, to virtues, and to good works, and at the same time doing bodily work. The first care was in Mary Magdalene, who carefully looked to Jesus and to hearing his word; having left bodily work, she sat at his feet. The second care was in Martha, for she had care about Jesus and his disciples, what she might give them to eat; but in that work she was troubled when she labored about bodily things. Therefore the Savior said to her, Luke 10:41: Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things. Then, besides these two cares, every other is evil, by which a person cares more about a lesser good than about a greater; as misers care more for wealth than for the kingdom of heaven, and many stand more in care for sin than for virtue, such as fornicators, drunkards, gluttons, gamblers, the proud, and liars. And these evil cares the Savior forbids; but good cares he does not forbid, rather he commands them, saying through Jeremiah: Be careful to keep all the commandments that are in the books of the law of Moses. And St Paul says, Ephesians 4:3: Be careful to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, that is, in love. And so, when the Savior says, “Do not be anxious,” he forbids evil care, but good care he does not forbid, nor good works. Therefore he does not say: do not work; but “do not be anxious about your soul,” that is, your living, and thus about your life, “what you will eat,” nor “about your body, what you will wear; surely your soul is more,” that is, more worthy and more precious to God, “than food, and your body more,” that is, more precious “than clothing or dress.”

G. Here note that the Savior sets out three things which the heavenly Father has given to a person: the soul, the body, and what is needful for both. The soul ought to be subject to God alone, the body to the soul, and wealth to both, as right reason demands. Misers overturn that order, giving both soul and body for wealth, as Judas did. Those also overturn that order whose bodies rule over their souls, such as gluttons, fornicators, and others who yield their bodies to mortal sin. And the Savior rejects a twofold care: one which he calls care for life, and that care is about food; the other he calls care for the body, and that is about clothing. And Christ rejects these two cares thus: A person’s life is more worthy, more precious, and thus better than his food, and the body is better than clothing; for both food and clothing are ultimately for the sake of the person. And since God has given both soul and body, and he will not forsake the order he himself has given, therefore he will give food for life and clothing for the body; therefore there ought not to be disordered anxiety about food and clothing. So we ought to turn all our diligence toward God and toward virtues and virtuous deeds, that we may please God; and here our care should stand, otherwise it would be disordered. And thus any care that is not ordered to the one goal, which is eternal joy, is an unworthy care. And care for life and body must be measured so that a person cares for food and clothing only as is fitting to his salvation.

From this you see that those who care in order to be rich, to be esteemed by the world, to dance, to make merriment, or to have games that do not help toward salvation, all such are, against this reading of Christ, anxious in a disordered way. For he goes on to say: “Look at the birds of the air.” St Luke in 12:24 says: Consider the ravens, that they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns, and your heavenly Father feeds them; your Father, who created you, gives you life, and if you obey him, he will give you your inheritance: the heavenly kingdom. “Are you not much more” (that is, of greater worth) “than they,” that is, you are much more precious than the birds: you who are rational, created for eternal joy, and the birds, created for your sake, irrational, who perish. “And which of you by thinking can add one cubit to his height?” That is as if he said: None of you; for that is not in your power. St Augustine says: This is: By whose power and rule did it come about that our body reached its present growth, and so it can be clothed also by his care? And it was not by your care that the body came to that growth, and even if by thinking you wanted to add one cubit, you could not; therefore entrust that care for clothing to him by whose care the body has grown. “And why are you anxious about clothing?” that is, in a disordered way; “consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not toil nor spin,” that is, for their adornment. When he says “they do not toil,” he rejects the disordered care of men, by which men care excessively; and when he says “nor spin,” he rejects the disordered care of women. “For I tell you that even Solomon in all his splendor,” that is, although he was wise, rich, and mighty, “was not clothed like one of them,” so beautifully in whiteness.

H. Here know that in Latin it stands: Considerate lilia; in Czech we do not know how to name lilium, which is a very white flower, whose whiteness Solomon could not attain on his robe. And it seems to me that by lilium Christ means the various flowers; therefore he said lilia, that is, many flowers, such as the lily, the rose, the violet, and other beautiful flowers. Therefore St Augustine says: What silk, what royal purple, what painted weaving of looms can be compared with flowers? What is so red as the rose? what is so white as the lily? and what purple surpasses the violet? So Augustine.

“For if God so clothes the grass of the field, which exists today and tomorrow is cast into the oven, will he not much more” (that is, surely clothe) “you of little faith,” that is, you who are of little faith if you will be anxious in a disordered way. “You,” says Augustine, “who are created in the likeness of God, who are destined for eternal inheritance in heaven—your Creator will arrange what is needful for you, and will not let you perish by nakedness.” So Augustine. Christ then goes on to say: “Therefore,” that is, since it is so, “do not be anxious, saying: What shall we eat? or what shall we drink? or with what shall we be clothed? For all these things the pagans seek,” for they do not have the true faith, thinking that they are to live only here. As St Augustine says, the pagans are intent on these things, for they do not care about future things, but are intent only on temporal and present things, like beasts of the earth that sniff after such things. As the prophet David says, Psalm 49:13, 21: They have made themselves like senseless beasts, and have been made like them. So Augustine. “Surely your Father knows that you need all these things.” “Your Father,” who cannot be lacking in power, in knowledge, or in goodwill, “knows” when, in what time, and in what measure you need “these things” for blessedness. Therefore, believing and trusting in him that he will not forsake you, “seek first the kingdom of God,” that is, above all desire and be diligent for the heavenly joy, “and his righteousness,” that is, every virtue that leads to the heavenly kingdom, “and all these things,” that is, what is needful for life and body, “will be added to you,” that is, in measure, as they can profit you for the heavenly kingdom. The Savior sets the kingdom first, which we must seek first; second he sets righteousness, which leads to that kingdom; and last he sets bodily necessities. In this he shows that the kingdom of heaven is the best thing; therefore it must be first in our desire; then righteousness, by which a person comes to the kingdom, and that must be second in desire; and third, food and clothing, as the least. May the dear Savior grant that we may have the joy of the eternal kingdom as what we most desire, and so, seeking it as Christ commands, at last attain it. Amen.
