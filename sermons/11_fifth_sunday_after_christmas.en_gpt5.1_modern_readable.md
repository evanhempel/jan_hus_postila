# Fifth Sunday After Christmas

From Matthew 8:23–27: At that time, when Jesus got into the boat, his disciples followed him. And suddenly a great storm rose up on the sea, so that the waves were covering the boat. But he was sleeping. The disciples came to him and woke him, saying, “Lord, save us, we are dying!” He said to them, “Why are you afraid, you of little faith?” Then he got up, ordered the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm on the sea. The people were amazed and said, “What kind of man is this, that even the sea and the winds obey him?”

This holy reading, on the surface, is easy enough to understand, yet within it lies strong instruction for the holy church—showing how we are to serve the Lord God. There are many reasons why Christ stepped into that boat. First, so that at the right time he could rest bodily with his disciples. Second, to teach us clearly that when we have a proper time of rest, we should use it for prayer, become devout, and then, having received instruction, go on to help others. Third, to teach us to flee flattery, just as Christ fled when they wanted to choose him as king (John 6:15). Now he entered the boat; and it was no accident that a storm broke out on the sea while Christ was sleeping. God arranged this in Christ so that, first, the disciples’ faith would be strengthened—that they would see by this miracle that he truly is God. Second, so that his true humanity would be proven, for he slept in the boat. Third, so that he would teach us to pray when we are in trouble. And fourth, to show us through the disciples that, just as they were afraid, so we too, because of our lack of faith, fall into fear.

This, then, is the special reason why our beloved Christ seems to “sleep” toward us and strike us with blows. For when the disciples woke him and said, “Lord, save us, we are dying,” he answered them plainly, “Why are you afraid, you of little faith?” Some of them had only a little faith, because they thought of him mainly as a man, or they believed very weakly that he is God. For if they had fully believed that he is the true God, they would have known that he could work miracles just as well while sleeping as while awake. It is the divinity—which never sleeps—that works miracles, not the humanity, which sometimes sleeps and sometimes stays awake.

From this we can understand that word of David in the psalm, Psalm 44:24: “Arise; why do you sleep, Lord?” For God does not really sleep in regard to people, except that their lack of faith makes it seem so. Just as he holds a rod that never sleeps over his faithful ones to discipline them, so he also stretches out a helping hand that never sleeps toward all who put their trust in him.

From this you must see that the apostles had no reason to be so afraid while they were with Christ. They ought to have known that no created thing can do anything against his full will, and that he cannot refuse help to anyone who fully trusts in him. As Paul says in 2 Timothy 2:13: “God is faithful; he cannot deny himself.”

You must also see from this that a person cannot fall into sin except because of a lack of faith, when it is a mortal sin. If he sins mortally, then either he has no true faith, or his faith is shaking and unsteady. Therefore James speaks rightly in James 2:26, that “faith without works is dead.” For whenever a person fails to love God above all things, at that very moment he has killed his faith. And since whenever he commits a mortal sin he does not love God at that time, it is clear that whenever he falls into mortal sin, he already has a lack in his faith.

Again: if people truly believed that God sees every sin, and that he will most certainly punish each one without fail, and if they constantly kept the torments of eternity before their eyes, they would not rush into sin so easily. But unbelief bends and sways them, and they say in their hearts, “Maybe God will not punish this so strictly.” And because of that “maybe” and that doubting, they are more ready to sin.

Therefore we need to say devoutly with his apostles to the Savior, as in Luke 17:5: “Lord, increase our faith”—that is, “Give us a full faith, without doubting and without wavering.”

In this wavering many people live today, in this time of Antichrist—especially priests, who do not dare to stand boldly for God’s truth. They are afraid that God might forget them if they do. And laypeople as well are afraid, worrying that tomorrow they may have nothing to eat if, for defending God’s truth, their possessions are taken from them. Others, for fear of losing their bodily food—like many servants—do not even dare to listen to the word of God. To all such people the Savior says in Matthew 6:25, 34: “Do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear. … Do not be anxious about tomorrow; tomorrow will be anxious for itself.”

From this same teaching you must understand that priests and lawyers of the law, who are filled with concern about their incomes and bodily needs, and who secure for themselves their stipends and benefices, are people of little faith. They do not trust the gracious Savior to feed them without all that securing, as the disciples trusted him when they were filled with the Holy Spirit.

The spiritual teaching in this reading is that we should follow Jesus and sail with him across the sea of this miserable world. The boat must be a firm hope, by which we trust that we will come safely through both storm and sea. The storms are the great temptations. And the sea, which heaves upward and then sinks down again, is the prosperity and changes of this world, by which a person is sometimes lifted up and sometimes cast down.

Therefore we must sit firmly in the boat of hope in God. And when any despair or doubting begins to pour in, we must resist it and cry out to our beloved Lord that he will not allow that storm to overthrow us. We must not sleep long among the “sea creatures” of this world—those sweet temptations that lure us into fornication and other bodily pleasures, and into climbing up in worldly status, which greedy people chase after with great haste, not knowing that the higher they climb, the harder they will fall.

From such a fall may our beloved Christ be pleased to rescue us.
