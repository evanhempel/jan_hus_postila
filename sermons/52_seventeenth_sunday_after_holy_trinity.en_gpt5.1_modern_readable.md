# Seventeenth Sunday After Holy Trinity

The Gospel is from St. Luke, chapter 14, verses 1–11.

“At that time, when Jesus went into the house of one of the rulers of the lawyers on the Sabbath to eat bread, they were watching Him closely. And behold, a man with dropsy was right in front of Him. And Jesus, answering what they were thinking, said to the experts in the Law and to the lawyers, ‘Is it permitted to heal on the Sabbath?’ But they kept silent. So He took hold of the man, healed him, and sent him away. Then He said to them, ‘Which of you, if his donkey or ox falls into a well, will not immediately pull it out on the Sabbath day?’ And they were not able to answer Him about these things. And He told a parable to those who were invited, when He noticed how they were choosing the best seats, and He said to them: ‘When you are invited to a wedding feast, do not sit down in the place of honor, in case someone more important than you has been invited by the one who asked you both; and then the one who invited both you and him comes and says to you, “Give this man your place,” and then you will begin, with shame, to take the last place. But when you are invited, go and sit in the last place, so that when the one who invited you comes, he may say to you, “Friend, move up higher.” Then you will have honor in the presence of those who sit at the table with you. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.’”

This holy reading is both very comforting and very serious for our instruction. In it we hear about Jesus, about the “masters” and the lawyers, and about the man with dropsy.

In Jesus this reading shows us humility, mercy, divine power, and perseverance in doing good.

In the masters and lawyers it shows us the evil of hypocrisy, envy, lack of mercy, and pride.

In the man with dropsy we first see his need, and then we see his healing.

St. Luke begins about Jesus like this: “When Jesus had gone into the house of one of the rulers of the lawyers”—that is, of the one who had invited Him—“to eat bread on the Sabbath,” and here you should also understand other foods with the bread.

Know this: that lawyer had invited Jesus to a meal, as St. Luke says a little after this reading, and he did it in order to test Him, joining with the other lawyers in this plan.

Yet the gracious Savior, knowing this, went to His enemies and ate with them, in order to show perfect love and to benefit even His enemies by His teaching and by His humble fellowship with them. In this way He taught the one who invited Him, He taught the others who were there, and He is also teaching us.

That lawyer, who was a ruler over the other lawyers—something like an abbot over other monks—He taught in this way: “When you give a dinner or a supper, do not invite your friends, or your brothers, or your relatives, or your rich neighbors, in case they also invite you back and you have your repayment. But when you make a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, because they have nothing with which to repay you; but you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”

If only people would take this holy word seriously, then they would not invite the proud rich out of vanity, but they would invite the poor. For the poor will not invite them back in return—but the Savior, on the Day of Judgment, will call the merciful on behalf of the poor, saying (Matthew 25:34–35): “Come, you who are blessed by My Father! Receive the kingdom prepared for you; for I was hungry and you gave Me food, I was thirsty and you gave Me drink.”

But to the rich who invite only themselves and never the poor, He will push them into hell, saying (Matthew 25:41–42): “Go away from Me, you cursed, into the eternal fire! For I was hungry and you did not give Me food, I was thirsty and you did not give Me drink.”

Next the reading shows how the masters and the lawyers behaved toward Jesus, when it says: “And they were watching Him closely”—that is, they were carefully spying on Him in His actions and in His words, so that they might catch Him in something.

Jesus had priests and lawyers watching His deeds, opponents in His speech, and mockers in His suffering.

And what were they watching for at that meal? The explanation says: they were watching to see whether He would break the Sabbath. That is why they invited Him on the Sabbath—that is, on a holy feast day—and they set up the man with dropsy in front of Him.

So, as if to show their sly cleverness, St. Luke writes: “And behold, a man with dropsy was in front of Him.”

“Dropsy” is that disease where water gathers in the body; when the stomach does not work properly, the moisture runs under the skin, between skin and flesh, it swells the person, and it spoils their inner breathing so that they stink.

Look—such a sick man they placed in front of Jesus. Otherwise, those masters and lawyers would hardly have allowed such a sick man to come to their table at a feast.

They placed him there with this intention: if Jesus did not heal him, they would say He was not merciful—He heals some and not others—or that He was not able to heal him. But if He did heal him, then they would say that He was breaking the Sabbath, that is, that He was not keeping the holy day which God had appointed on the Sabbath—just as we now keep Sunday.

St. Luke continues: “And Jesus, answering”—that is, answering their thoughts, by which they assumed that it was not allowed to heal on the Sabbath—“said to the experts in the Law,” that is, to the masters, “and to the lawyers: ‘Is it permitted to heal on the Sabbath?’”

Wise Master Jesus! The trap they had set for Him, He turns around and fastens it on their own necks.

When they realized that whatever answer they gave would expose their shame, they became silent.

He questioned them, knowing full well that it is right to heal on the Sabbath. They kept silent, not knowing what they could answer for their own correction. That is why the reading says: “And they kept silent.”

But the gracious Healer did not want to abandon mercy because of their malice; He wanted to show that it is right to do a merciful work on the Sabbath. “He took hold of” the sick man—that is, He touched him with His hand—“and healed him and let him go,” that is, He sent him away healthy.

The merciful Jesus took him by the hand, not because He needed to do that in order to heal, but to show humility and to give us an example: that we should not shrink back from the sick when we can help them.

“And answering them”—that is, those who thought it was not permitted to heal on the Sabbath—“He said, ‘Which of you, if his donkey or ox falls into a well, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?’”

By this question the Savior proves that it is right to heal the sick on the Sabbath. For since they would pull out a donkey or an ox that had fallen into a well on the Sabbath, even with great labor, then surely it was fitting for Jesus, without any labor, to pull a man out of his sickness. That is a work of mercy. The other is not really mercy—unless someone, out of pure compassion, would pull a stranger’s donkey out of a well.

Here He rebukes them for their evil: they valued a donkey or an ox more highly than the health of their neighbor.

In this sin, and in an even greater one, are today’s prelates, masters, and lawyers, who value their livestock more than the spiritual health of their neighbors.

That is why St. Bernard says to Pope Eugenius: “If a she‑donkey falls, there is someone to lift her up; but a soul is perishing, and there is no one who will even think about it.”

St. Bernard knew that the pope’s apostles—that is, his officials—were more diligent caretakers of his donkeys and mules than of souls that had sunk into the mud of sins.

And just as those Jews, out of greed, would pull a donkey out of the well and then claim they had not broken the Sabbath—but if anyone healed a sick person, they said he was breaking the Sabbath—so it is today.

What they do out of greed, they do not count as sin; but what someone does out of mercy, *that* they call sin.

Look: those Jews, for fear of losing a donkey, would immediately pull it out when it fell into the well, so it wouldn’t die; yet to the sick man they said, “It is not permitted to be healed on the Sabbath!”

And today they say that it is not permitted to preach the word of God without their permission, or to pull sinners out of their sins. But they say it *is* permitted for them to sell church benefices however they please, and that people must obey whatever they command.

Yet in the end they will fall silent before Jesus, just as those Jews did, of whom the reading says: “And they were not able to answer Him about these things.” For by then they had already been overcome by the truth.

“And He also spoke a parable to those who were invited,” and so on.

First, the gracious Savior had taught the masters and lawyers about mercy, and that it is no sin to heal the sick on a feast day. Now here He teaches them and others about humility, using the picture of a physical wedding feast.

He speaks in a parable, but by it He means the *spiritual* wedding—that is, the union between Christ and the holy Church. This holy Church is the assembly of all those chosen for salvation.

To that wedding Christ calls every person who is now traveling through this life—He calls you by inner spiritual prompting, or by preaching, or by other signs.

The “first place” at that wedding is the highest rank of honor before God, given as a reward. So the one who, at that wedding, takes the first seat in a self‑important way is the one who considers himself worthy of the highest dignity before God, as if he were the most noble one before God.

In this way, if the pope, by his own choice, accepts that he is the “most holy father” on earth, without any revelation from God that he really is such a person, then, against this command of Christ, he is seating himself in the first place at Christ’s wedding feast.

But every person here on earth ought, with humility, to hope about his own rank and trust that Christ will give him a place according to his works. Therefore he should sit down in the last place—that is, count himself as the least of those chosen for salvation.

For on the Day of Judgment Christ, who has called all people to that wedding, will exalt each one according to his works, without showing favoritism as others do.

Then, the very lowest place after the Judgment will be the place of eternal condemnation, which will be deepest in the middle of the earth—as is fitting, that hell should be there, as some of the saints say.

But the lowest place *here in this world*, the place where Christ commands us to sit, is the smallest dignity of God’s chosen before God. And each of us ought to desire that place humbly, not making ourselves more worthy than others, and not ranking ourselves with the greater saints.

A reasonable person can easily understand that Christ is not really speaking here about a physical wedding, nor about a physical seat.

First, because His command would not fit in every case. If a king were invited to someone’s wedding, it would not be fitting for him to sit in the very last seat.

Second, because it would not be fitting for *everyone* at a physical wedding to sit in the lowest place—there would be strife among the guests for that place, and in any case not everyone can sit in the last seat.

But at Christ’s wedding, everyone who sits in the last place—as we have already said—Christ will say to him on the Day of Judgment: “Friend, move up higher.” And then he will have praise in front of those who sit with him.

“For everyone who exalts himself” here in this world, in an unruly way by pride—if he does not repent—“will be humbled” before God; “and everyone who humbles himself”—that is, who behaves in a humble way—“will be exalted,” if he finishes his life in such humility.

Notice how glorious Christ’s parable is for this purpose, which He spoke when He *saw*—in Latin *intendens*, that is, understanding—so I render it “seeing,” that is, divinely knowing their intentions—“how they chose the first seats,” that is, they chose the best places to sit, “they were *wanting* them”—they had in their hearts a will for those seats.

Just as, sadly, people now choose them and chase after them—especially the masters, priests, and lawyers. As the Savior says in Matthew 23:6, they “love the best places at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,” and in the same way they love bishoprics and other promotions.

If only we would notice this word of Christ and remember it, so that it would not be said to any one of us: “Give this man your place!” and so we would not begin to hold the lowest place with shame.

Why? Because St. Gregory says: “The higher the step, the harder the fall.” And St. Jerome says: “We rejoice in promotion, but we should fear the fall. For the joy of being exalted is not as great as the sorrow of falling from exaltation.”

O misery for those who choose positions of dignity in Christendom for pleasure, for greed, and for pride, and who fight and go to court over them!

Let them allow this word to touch them, and consider whether it applies to them, when St. Luke says that “Christ spoke a parable to those who were invited,” understanding—and “seeing how they chose for themselves the first places,” He said to them: “When you are invited to a wedding”—that is, to Christ’s wedding, for He is the Bridegroom of the holy Church, having betrothed her to Himself and chosen her—“do not sit”—that is, do not boldly settle your desire—“in the first place,” that is, in the first dignity before God, “in case someone more honorable than you”—more honorable before God than you—“has been invited by the one who invited you.”

More honorable before God is the one who is more humble, as Christ says at the end of our reading: “Whoever humbles himself will be exalted.” Even the pagan Aristotle felt his way to this truth and said: “Honor is the reward of virtue.” That is, the one who is virtuous deserves to be honored.

But Christians today are reversed: they honor those who are rich, and they despise those who are virtuous. Christ does the opposite. He says in Luke 16:15: “What is exalted among people is disgusting before God.”

He said this to the masters and lawyers when they were mocking Him for preaching against greed. He told them: “You are the ones who make yourselves righteous before people, but God knows your hearts.”

So the dear Savior is always putting down pride and lifting up humility.

The reading continues: “And the one who invited both you and him will come”—that is, on the Day of Judgment—“and will say to you, ‘Give this man your place,’” that is, this dignity you wanted belongs to him; give way to him for it.

And this is exactly what happens at physical weddings and feasts.

“And then,” once you have been removed from that place, “you will begin with shame to take the last place.”

O misery for the proud who will be thrown down into the last place with Lucifer!

“But when you are invited to a wedding, go”—that is, with a humble desire—“and sit in the last place,” which is the least dignity of the chosen here in this world.

That is how the holy apostle Paul sat down, saying in 1 Corinthians 15:9: “I am the least of the apostles and I am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God,” that is, God’s holy people.

But now, notice this: when you want to humble yourself, be careful that you do not make a greater pride out of it—like those who, when they come to a feast, sit with their body in the lowest place, but with their desire in the first place. Before people they look humble, but before God they are proud.

St. John Chrysostom speaks beautifully to this. He says: “How many are proud who sit in the lower place with their bodies, but by the rising of their heart it seems to them that they are sitting in the first place; and how many are humble who sit in the first place, but in their conscience they count themselves in the last place!”

He says this about Christ’s words in Matthew 23:6–7: “They love the places of honor at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called ‘master’ by people.”

So now listen to Christ, who says: “Go”—that is, with a humble desire—“and sit in the last place, until the one who invited you comes”—on the Day of Judgment—“and says to you, ‘Friend!’”—because of your humility and other virtues—“‘move up higher,’” that is, receive a place of greater dignity than you ever thought you would have.

“Then”—that is, at that time and afterward forever—“you will have praise in the presence of those who sit at the table with you,” that is, before all who rest together in the one blessedness, and so before all the saints.

“For everyone” who “exalts himself” disorderly here in this world “will be humbled” before God and in the world to come, unless he repents; and “whoever humbles himself”—who, with a humble heart, sits down in the last place—“will be exalted” before God, both here and in eternal joy.

Amen.
