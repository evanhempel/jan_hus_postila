SEVENTH SUNDAY AFTER HOLY TRINITY.  
Saint Mark, chapter 8, verses 1–9.

At that time, when a great crowd was with Jesus and the people had nothing to eat, he called his disciples to him and said to them: “I have compassion on the crowd, for look, they have already stayed with me three days and they have nothing to eat; and if I send them away hungry to their home, they will collapse on the road, for some of them have come from far away.” And his disciples answered him: “From where could anyone now feed these people with bread in the wilderness?” He asked them, in order to teach them: “How many loaves do you have?” They said: “Seven.” He ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground. And taking the seven loaves, after giving praise, he broke them, as was his custom, and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd. They also had a few small fish; he blessed these as well and ordered that they too be set before them. They ate, and were satisfied; and they collected what was left over from the broken pieces, seven baskets. And those who had eaten were about four thousand people; and he sent them away to their homes.

A. Our Savior, according to this reading, showed that he is true God and true man: God, in that he fed a great crowd with only a few loaves; man, in that he lived bodily among people. He also showed his diligence for our salvation, in that he preached for three days in the wilderness; and he showed his mercy when he said, “I have compassion on the crowd.” He also gave instruction to rulers, both spiritual and secular. First, that they should ask advice when they want to do something beneficial. The reading says: “He called his disciples,” and said to them, “I have compassion on the crowd!” The explanation says: he calls the disciples so as to teach those who are exalted to take counsel from those beneath them. The second lesson is that princes, lords, and prelates should be merciful to their people, and in their need give them food, so that they do not perish; and that priests especially should put before the poor the bread which they receive from him as alms. The third lesson is that they should gather the leftovers and give them to the poor, so that they do not perish. But now they rather give those leftovers to dogs or to swine than to the poor members of Christ; and by that deed they show that dogs are dearer to them than the poor. That is for the reading, as far as the outward words go.

The spiritual teaching is this: that a bishop, pastor, or any other priest set over the people must, like Christ, be diligent in preaching and set the word of God before the people, so that they do not perish on the road they must travel to eternal joy. And the people are to endure “three days,” that is, to turn away from sin, as Saint Augustine says, and turn to God in thought, in speech, and in deed. For the merciful Savior does not want to send them home hungry, without nourishment, lest they perish on the way. For those who are converted and doing penance would perish on the road of this world if they did not feed on the word of God; therefore they must be admonished by the word of God. Thus Augustine. And again he says: Oh, that you, Lord Jesus, would say this about us: “I do not want them to perish in hunger! But deign to give us food, that we may be able to reach the road that leads to the heavenly homeland; for many perish on that road, but only those who do not partake of the food from your table.” Thus Augustine. Saint Augustine also weighs these words of the Savior: “If I send them away hungry to their home, they will collapse on the road; for some of them have come from far away.”

B. And he speaks thus: That gracious word must surely be greatly esteemed, which came from the mouth of Truth, who says: “Some of them have come from far away.” For there is a person who has not tasted anything crooked, no bodily corruption; he has hastened to the service of God. Such a one has not come from far away, for by his purity and his innocence he has been very near. Another, not stained by any foulness or any wicked deeds, having experienced only marriage, turns to spiritual service; he has not come from far away, for he has used only the loaned estate of marriage and has not strayed into unworthy things. But some, after bodily sins, some after false oaths, some after theft, some after murders, return to repentance and turn to the service of Almighty God. Surely these are the ones who are returning from far away to the Lord! For the more a person has wandered, the farther he has gone away from the Lord. The prodigal son who left his father went away into a far country where he fed swine, that is, he fed sins. Therefore, food must be given also to those who come from far away; for converted sinners must be given the food of holy teaching, that they may be strengthened in God and regain the strength that they lost through their sins. All the more do they need to be filled by preachers with holy teaching, the more they have been weakened by sins and have now returned again. All this is from Saint Augustine. And Saint Bede and Saint Remigius give the same understanding.

May the merciful Savior grant that those who are from far away—that is, from great sins—may no longer perish; and that those who have not yet come to Jesus may return, and may feed on his spiritual bread, on his word and on his body, being with him “three days,” that is, having true faith, hope, and love toward him. For in this way, sitting down on the ground—that is, suppressing bodily desires—they will eat from the seven loaves, that is, they will share in the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, which the merciful Savior bestows, giving to each according to his will, so that, being satisfied, each of the elect may rest with him in joy forever. Amen.
