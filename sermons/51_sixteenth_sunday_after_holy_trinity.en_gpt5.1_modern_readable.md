# Sixteenth Sunday After Holy Trinity

Luke 7:11–16

At that time Jesus went to a town called Nain. His disciples were going with him, and a large crowd as well. As he came near the town gate, a dead man was being carried out—the only son of his mother, and she was a widow, and a large crowd from the town was with her. When the Lord saw her, he was moved with compassion for her and said to her, “Do not weep.” Then he came up and touched the bier, and those who were carrying it stood still. And he said, “Young man, I say to you, arise!” And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and he gave him back to his mother. And fear seized them all, and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us,” and, “God has visited his people.”

From this reading, Luke shows us several things.

First, he shows that our Savior was diligent in preaching, when he says: “Jesus went to a town called Nain.” “He went” – understand that as: he went to preach.

Second, he shows the devotion of the people who were eager to hear the word of God, when he says: “His disciples were going with him, and a large crowd.”

Third, he tells what happened as Jesus approached the gate: “As he came near the town gate, a dead man was being carried out.”

Fourth, he shows what Jesus, in mercy, did for the dead man and for his mother.

And fifth, he tells us that when the people saw this great miracle of Jesus, they praised God and said that Jesus was a great prophet.

So in Jesus we see both divine power and mercy: his power, in that by his word he raised the dead man; his mercy, in that he was moved with compassion and did this both to comfort the grieving widow and for our spiritual benefit.

Taken only at the level of the story, this reading is easy to understand. But there is also a spiritual meaning, which Saint Augustine and Saint Bede bring out.

This dead young man represents a person whose soul is dead through mortal sin.

The widow represents the holy assembly, the holy Church.

The bier or bed represents the careless conscience of the sinner.

Those who carry the bier represent evil desires or wicked companions who are carrying the sinner toward damnation.

But many simple people pay no attention to this. They hear what Christ did and they marvel, but they do not lift their minds any higher.

Saint Augustine, preaching on this, says something like this:

“The miracles of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ move all who hear and believe them—but they move people in different ways. Some are fleshly people, who are amazed at the miracles in the body and do not want to look toward greater things. Others, when they hear about works done in the body, are even more amazed at what is done in the soul.

“Every person has eyes with which he can see the resurrection from the dead, like the one we heard today about the son of this widow. But not everyone has eyes in the heart to see that the dead are also raised within. Only those see this who have already been raised in their hearts. For it is a greater thing to be raised so as to live forever, than to be raised only to die again.

“The widow rejoiced when her son in the body was raised; and for those people who are raised every day in their souls, the holy Church rejoices. That young man was dead in his body, but those others were dead in their souls. His death was outward and was openly wept over; their death was not seen—they did not seek it out, and they did not see it.

“He who knew the dead sought them out. Only he knew the dead, who could make them alive. For if he had not come to raise the dead who were not yet physically dead, the apostle would not have said (Ephesians 5:14): ‘Awake, you who sleep, and rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.’ When you hear, ‘Rise from the dead!’ you hear that this is said to someone dead.”

Saint Augustine goes on:

“We read of three people who were clearly raised from the dead, and of thousands who were raised invisibly. So let us see what he wanted to teach us by these three whom he raised from the dead.”

He then lists those whom Christ visibly raised: the little girl, the young man, and Lazarus.

The little girl represents a person who has consented to sin in the soul, but has not yet carried it out in action. This is shown by the fact that the girl had not yet been carried out of the room in which she died.

The young man represents a person who, having consented to mortal sin, has completed it outwardly by an act, but has not yet formed a habit of it. This is shown by the fact that the young man was already being carried out through the gate, just as sin is carried out from the mind into the outward life.

Lazarus, who stank, represents the person who, after consenting to mortal sin and committing it, continues in it for a long time. This is shown by Lazarus lying in the tomb for four days already and beginning to stink.

For this is how the death of the soul happens. First, there is *lektánie*—that is, pleasure or delight in the heart over sin—and at that stage there is not yet spiritual death. Second, there is consent to mortal sin, and then there is already death of the soul. Third comes the act. Fourth comes the habit.

There are some people who, when an evil thought rises in the mind, at once push it away, so that they do not even take pleasure in it. There are some who take pleasure in it but do not consent—then death is not yet finished, though it has in a way begun. When consent is added to pleasure, then death is already there. After that comes the act; after that, a settled habit; and then, despair.

Christ raised three people clearly and outwardly during his preaching to show that he raises three types of souls dead in mortal sin: those who only inwardly consent to mortal sin; those who also commit mortal sin outwardly but not yet habitually; and those who have fallen into a habit of sin.

But beyond that he does not raise anyone, for he leaves those in despair in their despair, because they do not want to repent. Thus the Lord God forgives mortal sin whether it is only of consent, or of deed, or of habit—so long as despair is not added at the end. Despair is the final impenitence for sin, when a person ultimately does not repent, that is, does not grieve over his sins. As the Savior says (Matthew 12:32), that sin is against the Holy Spirit and will not be forgiven, neither here nor after death—because here he does not grieve over it, and after death he will not be able to grieve.

I ought now to tell in detail how Christ raised the little girl, how he raised the young man, and how he raised Lazarus. But that would take too long, so I must pass it by.

Yet I do want to emphasize, as Saint Augustine says, that if there is someone who has already begun to stink—that is, someone long hardened in sin—and when he is admonished and admonished again by the word of truth, rises at the voice of Christ from the dead and then lives, that person might have gone far in sin, but he cannot finally perish forever.

But others, who do evil and are bound by the evil habit so that their habit will not allow them even to see that it is evil—they become defenders of their own sins, they get angry when they are rebuked. This is like the men of Sodom who once said to the righteous man who rebuked their worst desires (Genesis 19:9): “You have come here to stay, but not to give us laws!” Such a strong habit of unspeakable vileness was there that now their wickedness was counted as righteousness, and the one who tried to restrain them from sinning was punished, while the one who sinned was not punished. Such people are crushed and buried under their evil habit.

All this is from Saint Augustine.

Let anyone who wants to, look around and see whether it is not the same today as it was among those men of Sodom—if not in that particular sin, then in adultery, fornication, and greed—especially among priests, who are already so used to sinning, to living in sexual immorality and greed, that when a righteous person, desiring their salvation, rebukes their evil, they immediately turn on him and say, “If you want to live with us, do as we do, and do not set up new laws for us!”

They have been so pressed down under a devilish habit that they already stink as if buried.

So, just as Martha, almost without hope that Christ would raise Lazarus, said (John 11:39): “Lord, by this time he already stinks, for he has been dead four days,” in the same way many today, seeing the stinking habits of the priesthood in immorality and greed, in pride and luxury, grow afraid that many of them will never be raised—unless the cry and call of Christ before many witnesses draws some of them out of that habit.

For just as Christ, with tears and a loud cry in front of many, raised Lazarus from the stench and from the dead, so now by a public cry and weeping some of them can, by the power of God, rise out of that stinking habit. As an interpreter says: “Public sin needs public medicine.”

Therefore Saint Augustine says: “The Lord came, for whom all things are easy, and there he showed some kind of difficulty: he was troubled, he cried out. He showed that a great cry is needed in rebuking those who have hardened themselves by habit. Yet, at the cry of the Lord Christ, the bonds of wretched death were torn apart, the power of hell trembled, Lazarus came back alive. For the Lord delivers even from evil habit those who are four days dead. Lazarus, dead four days, was still sleeping for Christ when Christ wanted to raise him.”

So far Augustine.

And at the end of his sermon he says something like this:

“He has died deeply, whose soul is pressed down under the habit of sin. But the exalted Christ knows how, by his cry, to break heavy burdens; he knows how to give life within; he knows how to hand the one he has loosed over to his disciples. Do you also do repentance! For though Lazarus had been dead four days, when he rose from the dead he was not left in shame for having died.

“So you who are alive—be truly alive. And all of you who are in any way dead with one of these three deaths, do what you must so that you soon rise from the dead.”

That is Augustine.

Now I return to the reading, which says: “Jesus went to a town called Nain.”

“Nain” means “movement.” It represents this world, in which people have moved out of their proper place and calling, from the highest to the lowest.

Saint Jeremiah says (Jeremiah 8:10): “From the least to the greatest, all are eager for greed; and from priest to prophet, all practice deceit.”

Thus priests have moved away from the voluntary poverty of Christ, and from chastity, purity, and humility, into greed, immorality, and pride.

So David says of them that they have been moved, and fear has seized them (Psalm 48:6 in his numbering). They have been moved away from following Christ and have grabbed for lordship, and so fear surrounds them—just as it did the Jewish priests regarding Christ. They are afraid of losing their possessions; therefore they build defenses on every side so that no one may preach against their greed, lest their wealth decrease. But without doubt, in trying to keep their goods, they will lose them.

Rulers, lords, and common people too have moved into sin, away from God’s commandments, for many do not keep marriage, nor kinship purity, nor virginity. There are few indeed who have not turned aside from the command, “You shall not commit adultery.”

So together they are all like that town moved out of place, to which Jesus went—and still goes—by his preaching, so that they might give up their sins.

His disciples also go with him—faithful priests and others—preaching and breaking up the sins of that town moved away from God’s commandments.

A great crowd also goes after Jesus, and not all in that crowd are good. Many are evil Christians, who also preach and speak against evil, and yet are evil themselves.

“As Jesus came near the gate of the town…”

The gate of that town—that is, of that people who have moved away from God’s command—is the freedom to sin. Through this gate they carry the dead man—that is, the person dead in mortal sin—to a double burial: into the grave of sinful habit and into the grave of eternal damnation.

He is carried by four bearers: first, the hope of long-lasting health; second, the hope of future repentance; third, the hope of God’s mercy; fourth, flattery.

They carry the sinner like this: he says, “I will be healthy for a long time; I’ll repent later. And God is merciful; he will forgive.” And the flattery of priests and others pushes him on, saying, “That is not really a sin for you; or if it is, it is only a small one. You can clear it away with alms; you can have masses said; give the priests a payment of a couple of coins, and they will sing vigils for you forever.”

And so these bearers drag the soul of this dead man into the grave of evil habit and the grave of hell, and they want this young man to stink in the grave like Lazarus.

But the widow—that is, the holy Church, the assembly of the saints who are still here in this world—is called a widow because her husband, Christ, does not yet live visibly with her here; she waits for him to return to her. This widow goes weeping for her son, for all faithful Christians here walk in longing after the sinner and weep for him because he is dead in his soul.

A faithful Christian has no greater reason to weep than this: that he himself has sinned, and that he sees another sinning. Therefore our merciful Savior wept and said (Matthew 5:4): “Blessed are those who mourn.”

But today, sadly, Christians weep when something goes against them, or when a friend dies in the body. Yet they do not weep when they themselves are dead in the soul, nor when they see that their neighbors are dead in the soul.

So Saint Augustine says: “Are there compassionate inner parts in you, Christian, if you weep over a body from which the soul has departed, and you do not weep over a soul from which God has departed?”

That is Augustine.

Truly it is certain: that person is not a real Christian who, seeing his neighbor sin mortally and thus die in his soul, does not grieve for him and at least does not weep in his heart and groan when he sees such a great disaster and such an injury done to his Savior.

But the widow—that is, the community of true Christians—weeps over everyone who is dead in soul. With her goes a large crowd. Some weep with her—these are her good friends, faithful Christians. Others do not weep—these are those who feel no pity for sinners dead in soul.

When Jesus sees this widow, “he is moved with compassion for her and says to her, ‘Do not weep,’” meaning: “Do not think that your dead son will never rise. Trust that he will be made alive in his soul.”

“And he came up” – that is, by his power – “and touched the bier.”

The bier is the body of the sinner, on which the sinful soul is carried toward the habit of sin. For just as the body, once laid on the bier, is about to be put into the grave, so the soul, surrounded by mortal sin, has nothing left but this: if it departs from the body, it is immediately to be buried in hell.

We have proof of this, for Christ says (Luke 16:22–23): “The rich man died and was buried in hell.” The devils carry the soul to hell before people carry the body to the grave. And even if no devil came after the soul, mortal sin itself would at once throw it down there.

“Those who carried him stood still.”

That happens when Christ touches the bier—that is, the body of the sinner—by his hand, that is, by his power, in answer to the widow’s tears. Then the bearers stand still: the hope of long health, the hope of later repentance, the hope of God’s mercy, and flattery.

They stand still in this way: the repentant person lays aside those three empty hopes and says, “Maybe I will die today and not repent. And though God is merciful, I must not sin against his mercy. Flattery does not make my sin any lighter; it wounds my soul even more and will not take away my torment. So I will no longer let myself be carried by these bearers into sin.”

Then Christ says to such a dead person when these bearers have stopped: “Young man, I say to you, arise!” And he sits up—that is, the one who was dead in soul finds rest from sin—and “begins to speak,” that is, he begins to give thanks and praise to God.

“And Christ gives him back to his mother”—that is, he returns him to the grace and fellowship of the holy Church.

And when people see this, “they will be amazed and glorify God,” saying that the Savior is a great prophet who lived among them and “came forth from them” in the flesh, so that he might raise the dead both in body and in soul, and, being God, might mercifully visit his people.

Notice also this: Christ raised a little girl, a young man, and a man, Lazarus—but no very old grandfather and no old woman.

In this there may be a sign, since these three persons represent sinners, that those who do not grow old and hardened in their sins can quickly rise from their sins; but those who do grow old in sin do not rise so quickly—just as twisted old wood is not easily straightened, and an old animal does not learn as quickly as a young one.

Let this be a shame to old men and old women who have delayed in faith and in the fear of God and are still like children in understanding. Of such a child Scripture says (Isaiah 65:20): “Cursed is the hundred-year-old child!”

May the Lord grant that they grow young again by the word of Jesus, who says, “Young man, I say to you, arise.” For here “young man” means that the sinner, raised by Christ, turns from old age to youth. Therefore Saint Peter says to Christians (1 Peter 2:2): “Like newborn, reasonable infants, without deceit, desire the milk.” This change is meant in that word, “young man.”

Second, the sinner finds peace from the torment of the devil—this is meant when the young man sat up.

Third, he will confess the praise of God—for the reading says that “he began to speak.”

And fourth, he will remain in grace—for the reading says that “he gave him back to his mother,” who is the bride of Jesus Christ.
