# Twentieth Sunday After Holy Trinity

From Matthew 22:1–14

At that time Jesus spoke with his disciples in parables, saying:  

“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who made a wedding feast for his son. He sent out his servants to call those who had been invited to the wedding, but they did not want to come.  

Again he sent other servants and said, ‘Tell those who are invited: Look, I have prepared my banquet; my oxen and my domestic birds are slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding!’  

But they paid no attention and went off—one to his own village, another to his business. The rest seized his servants, abused them with insults, and killed them.  

When the king heard about it, he was angry. He sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.  

Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. So go out to the exits of the roads, and invite to the wedding whoever you find.’  

So those servants went out into the roads and gathered all they found, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests who were sitting down.  

Then the king came in to look at the guests, and he saw there a man who was not dressed in wedding clothes. He said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?’ And the man was speechless.  

Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind his hands and feet and throw him into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.’ For many are called, but not many are chosen.”

Our merciful Savior, wanting to lead us to the knowledge of heavenly things, speaks in this parable about a physical, earthly wedding, in order to lead our minds to the spiritual wedding.

So that if someone rejoices to be invited to an earthly wedding, he would rejoice far more that he is invited to a spiritual wedding. And if anyone would be afraid of being cast out from an earthly wedding, he should fear much more being thrown out from the eternal wedding and, on top of that, cast into the outer darkness with his hands and feet bound.

Wanting to teach his disciples and also us, the Savior spoke in a parable, as today’s Gospel reading says: “Jesus spoke to his disciples in parables, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is like…’”

The “kingdom of heaven” here is the assembly of people in this world. It is called the kingdom of heaven because the heavenly King, God, is the King of that assembly. How “the kingdom of heaven” is explained in various ways in Scripture I have written earlier, in the eleventh sermon.  

For now, take this parable in today’s reading like this:  

As if an earthly king prepared a wedding banquet for his son, ordered that guests be invited to the wedding, and so on—just so God the Father, together with the whole holy Trinity, prepared a wedding for Christ as man, when the holy Trinity betrothed to him the whole assembly of the elect unto salvation, those of whom Christ says at the end of the reading that there are not many who are chosen.

And so that this wedding of Christ with his bride would be more fragrant and draw our desire more strongly, Christ says in this reading that the banquet at this wedding is already prepared.

Let us weigh carefully who the King is: God the Father. He made a wedding for his Son, Christ, by giving him the assembly of all the elect and thus making him this wedding.

St Gregory says: God the Father made a wedding for his Son when he joined him with humanity in the Virgin’s womb, when he willed that God, who is before all ages, should be a man at the end of the ages.

“He sent out his servants” – that means the prophets – “to call those who were invited” – that is, the Jews – “to the wedding,” that is, to faith in the incarnation of Christ. “But they did not want to come,” that is, they did not want to believe.

“Again he sent other servants” – meaning those who preached that the wedding banquet was now close at hand, those whom he sent just before Christ, like John the Baptist and others who announced that Christ was near – “saying, ‘Tell those who are invited’” – that is, preach to the Jews and to others: “‘Look, I have prepared my banquet’” – St Gregory says this means, “I have fulfilled the mystery of the incarnation.”  

“‘My oxen’” – that is, the prophets who were under the heavy yoke of the Law – “‘and my domestic birds’” – that is, the apostles, who are my gentle, house-trained birds – “‘are slaughtered, and everything’” – the place, the food, the drink – “‘is ready’” – that is, it is all prepared: the body of Christ, his blood, and the place in heaven are ready. “‘Come to the wedding!’” – that is, come by faith, by hope, and by love, doing good works.

“But they paid no attention,” unwilling to believe or to live rightly, “and went away: one to his village” – that points to greed, and from that to pride, when a man rules over wealth; “another to his business” – that means greed in acquiring possessions; “and the rest seized” – that is, arrested and imprisoned – “his servants,” like John the Baptist and other saints, Peter, James, and Andrew; “and after abusing them with insults and tortures, they killed them,” that is, they murdered them.

Notice this: evil are those who “paid no attention” and refused to believe. Worse are those who, knowing about the wedding, turned themselves toward greed and pride. But the worst of all are those who, after despising the servants of such a great King, then murdered them.

And the very worst, he says, are today’s priests, who with their mouths confess the faith of Christ, the Son of God, yet for the sake of their greed they kill, imprison, drive out, persecute, and even curse those who faithfully call them to the wedding.

“When the king heard” – heard their carelessness, their turning away, and the murder of his servants – “he was angry,” that is, he showed his vengeance, “and sent his armies” – with Titus and Vespasian – “and destroyed those murderers and burned their city,” that is, Jerusalem.

Or, as St Gregory explains: He destroyed those murderers because he wiped out his enemies; and he burned their city with fire, because not only their souls but also the bodies in which they lived are tormented by the flames of eternal fire.

The reading goes on: “Then he said to his servants…” – that is, afterward he said this to his servants, when the Jews had refused to believe – “to his servants,” that is, to the apostles: “‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited’” – the Jews – “‘were not worthy,’ because of their ingratitude toward him who invited them.

“‘Therefore go out to the exits of the roads’” – that means, go among the Gentiles who had left the right road. And so it happened: when the Jews would not believe, the apostles went among the Gentiles.

That is why St Paul and St Barnabas said to the Jews, as we read in Acts 13:46: “The word of God had to be spoken to you first. But since you push it away and show that you are unworthy of eternal life, look, we are turning to the Gentiles.”

This is what is meant when Christ says, “Go out to the exits of the roads, and whoever you find” – without showing favoritism – “invite to the wedding,” that is, to the faith in Christ’s incarnation.

“So those servants” – the apostles – “went out,” obediently, “into the roads and gathered” – that is, brought into Christian faith – “both good and bad,” the elect for salvation and those foreknown for damnation. For both kinds are found among Christians, all confessing the faith with their mouths.

So among Christians there are good and bad, just as in a net there swim both good fish and bad, and on a threshing floor there is both grain and chaff.

“And the wedding was filled,” that is, the number of wedding guests was completed, those who are called “those who sit” at the wedding.

“Then the king came in” – that is, he will come on the Day of Judgment – “to look at the guests, and he saw there a man” – St Gregory says, meaning by this the whole assembly of the condemned – “who was not dressed in a wedding garment,” that is, who lacked love, which clothes every true wedding guest, the children of God and the bride of Christ.

Love is called the wedding garment because Christ, out of great love, was willing to take on flesh and prepare this wedding.

Second, it is called the wedding garment because love covers many sins – not in the sense of hiding them so no one knows, but so that the wedding guest does not bear shame for them.

Third, love is the garment because it guards us from eternal cold.

Fourth, because it makes the wedding guest beautiful.

Therefore we must be diligent to be clothed with love.

On this St Gregory speaks in today’s sermon like this:

“We know, dearest brothers, that we sit at the wedding of the Son of God. We already share faith in the Christian congregation. We already eat the food of Holy Scripture. We rejoice that the holy Church has been joined with God.  

“So pay attention: have you come to this wedding in a wedding garment?  

“Examine your thoughts carefully; turn your hearts over in every matter. Do you truly have no hatred against anyone? Is there no fire of envy burning in you at another’s good fortune? Do you not secretly want to harm anyone with hidden malice?  

“Look, the King comes into the wedding and examines the state of our hearts. And when he does not find someone clothed with love, he immediately says in anger, ‘Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?’  

“Friend in faith, but not in deeds!”

That is St Gregory.

“And the man was speechless” – he fell silent and had no answer. He had confessed God with his mouth and denied him with his deeds; now even his speech fails him.

St Gregory says: “At the final judgment every excuse will stop. The one who judges from the outside is also, as witness, testifying inside, in the conscience.”

That is St Gregory.

“Then the king said to the servants” – that is, to the angels: “‘Bind his hands and feet.’” The hands, so that he will never again do anything useful for salvation. The feet, so that he will never again walk toward any joy.

The torment binds his hands and feet, but before that they were already bound by the guilt of sin. These are “the hands” that were unwilling to give to the poor; these are “the feet” that were unwilling to go to the sick.

As Christ says in Matthew 25:42–43, “I was hungry, and you did not give me food; I was sick, and you did not come to me.”

“‘Throw him into the outer darkness’” – that is, into the darkness of eternal damnation.

Understand this: the inner darkness are the sins that live in the soul and drive out the light of the Holy Spirit – that is, true understanding. The outer darkness are the lack of light that shines on bodily things.

But especially, the “outer darkness” with which Christ often threatens are the darkness of eternal damnation, for after that there will never again be a day.

So St Gregory says: “It is rightly said that he will be thrown into outer darkness. We call the blindness of the heart inner darkness; we call eternal damnation outer darkness. Therefore each condemned person will not be left in the inner darkness, but thrown into the outer. For he who falls here in this life into the night of a blind heart will not escape falling there into the night of damnation.”

That is St Gregory.

“There will be weeping and grinding of teeth.”  

Weeping with the eyes that once looked in an unclean way; grinding with the teeth that once ate greedily.

“For many are called” to faith, “but not many are chosen” to feast forever at the wedding. Understand “not many” in comparison with the great number of those who are called.

St Gregory says: “So each one of us should humble himself all the more, because he does not know whether he is chosen. Many begin well, but they do not persevere to the end.”

May the Lord God grant that we be counted worthy of that wedding. Amen.
