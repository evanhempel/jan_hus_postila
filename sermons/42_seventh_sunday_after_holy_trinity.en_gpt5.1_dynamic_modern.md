# Seventh Sunday After Holy Trinity

The gospel reading for today is from Mark, chapter 8, verses 1–9.

At that time, a huge crowd was with Jesus.
They’d been with Him for three days already, and they had nothing left to eat.
So Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, “I feel deep compassion for this crowd.
They’ve stayed with Me these three days and have nothing to eat.
If I send them home hungry, they’ll collapse on the way, and some of them have come from far away.”

His disciples answered, “Out here in the wilderness, where could anyone find enough bread to feed all these people?”

Jesus asked them, “How many loaves do you have?”

They said, “Seven.”

Then He told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
He took the seven loaves, gave thanks to God, broke the bread, and gave the pieces to His disciples to set before the people.
And the disciples set them before the crowd.

They also had a few small fish.
Jesus blessed them as well and told the disciples to distribute them.
Everyone ate and was satisfied.
Afterward they picked up seven baskets full of broken pieces that were left over.
The number of people who ate was about four thousand.
Then Jesus sent them home.

Our Savior, through this reading, shows us clearly that He is both true God and true man.

He shows Himself to be God, because He feeds a huge crowd with just a few loaves of bread.
He shows Himself to be man, because He is there among the people in His human body, living and walking with them.

He also shows His great diligence, His tireless concern for our salvation:
He preached to them in the wilderness for three days.
And He shows His mercy in that beautiful sentence: “I feel compassion for this crowd.”

In this miracle He also gives a powerful lesson to leaders, both spiritual and worldly.

First, He teaches that those in authority should ask for counsel when they want to do something truly helpful.
Scripture says: “He called His disciples to Him and said, ‘I feel compassion for this crowd.’”
The explanation is this: He calls the disciples together to teach those who are exalted to take counsel from those under them.
Rulers, church leaders, and all in power should not be proud or isolated; they should be ready to listen.

Second, He teaches that princes, lords, and prelates must be merciful to their people.
When their people are in need, they should give them food so they don’t perish.
And priests especially should do this:
the bread they receive as alms—they should first lay that bread before the poor.

Third, He teaches that what is left over should be gathered and given to the poor so they do not die of hunger.
But now, people more often give the leftovers to dogs and pigs than to Christ’s poor members.
By doing this, they show that their dogs are dearer to them than the poor who belong to Christ.
That’s what this reading teaches us on the surface, as far as the words directly go.

Now let’s look at the spiritual meaning.

A bishop, a parish priest, or any pastor placed over God’s people must be like Christ here: diligent in preaching.
He must lay the bread of God’s word before the people so they do not perish on the journey they must travel toward eternal joy.

And the people must be willing to “bear with Him three days.”
*Saint Augustine* explains those “three days” like this:
it means turning away from sin and turning to God in thought, in speech, and in action.
That’s the threefold turning.
When people do that—when they are converted and repentant—our merciful Savior does not want to send them away hungry for His word.
He does not want them to collapse on the road.

Because if those who’ve turned back to God, those who are repenting, were sent out into the road of this world without feeding on God’s word, they would perish on the way.
That’s why they must be continually encouraged and nourished with God’s word.
That is what *Saint Augustine* teaches.

And again *Augustine* says:
“Oh, if only, Lord Jesus, You would say this also about us: ‘I do not want them to perish from hunger!’
But please, give us food, so that we may walk the road that leads to the heavenly homeland.
For many are perishing on that road—everyone, in fact, who does not eat from Your table.”
That is *Augustine* again.

He also urges us to pay close attention to this saying of the Savior: “If I send them away hungry to their homes, they will collapse on the way, for some of them have come from far.”

*Saint Augustine* explains it like this:

This merciful sentence that comes from the mouth of Truth Himself must be taken very seriously: “Some of them have come from far.”
What does that mean?

There are some people who have never tasted serious bodily corruption or gross outward sin.
From early on, they’ve hurried into God’s service.
That person has not “come from far,” because his innocence and his lack of serious corruption have kept him very near to God.

Another person has not stained himself with filthy, shameless living or other open evils, but has only known the bond of one marriage, and then later turned to spiritual service.
He also has not come from far, because he used what was permitted to him and did not wander into unworthy things.

But others—others return to repentance only after many bodily sins;
some after crooked, false oaths;
some after theft;
some after murders.
They turn back from these and turn to serve almighty God.

These people, *Augustine* says, truly “come from far” when they return to the Lord.
Because the more a person has wandered, the farther he has gone from the Lord.

The prodigal son is the picture of this.
He left his father and went into a “far country.”
There he fed pigs—that is, he was feeding sin and living in it.

So food must also be given to those who come from far.
Those converted sinners must be given the food of holy teaching.
They need to be strengthened in God and regain the strength they lost through their sins.
For that very reason they need the preaching of God’s word all the more:
the more they’ve been weakened by sin, the more they must be nourished now that they’ve come back.

This is all from *Saint Augustine*.
And *Saint Bede* and *Saint Remigius* give the same understanding.

May our merciful Savior grant this:
that those who have “come from far”—that is, out of great sins—will no longer perish;
and that those who still have not come to Jesus may turn back to Him and feed on His spiritual bread: His word and His body.

May they be “with Him three days,” that is, may they have true faith, firm hope, and burning love toward Him.

And may they “sit down on the ground,” that is, may they push down and subdue their bodily desires.

Then they will eat from the seven loaves—that is, they will share in the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, which our merciful Savior gives, distributing to each person as He wills.

And when every one of His chosen people has been fully satisfied, may each one rest with Him forever in eternal joy.

Amen.
