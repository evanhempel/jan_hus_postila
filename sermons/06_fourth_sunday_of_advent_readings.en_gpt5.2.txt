### READING FOR THE FOURTH SUNDAY IN ADVENT.
Saint John writes in chapter 1, verses 19–26.  
At that time the Jews from Jerusalem sent priests and deacons to John to ask him, saying, “Who are you?” And he confessed that he is not the Christ, and he did not deny what he was, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.” And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” And he answered, “I am not (that Elijah in person, as you suppose)!” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No (that is, I am not that Prophet, as you imagine).” Then they said to him, “Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?” He said, “I am the voice of one crying (of Christ) in the wilderness (of this world): ‘Make straight (by good deeds) the way of the Lord (of God),’ as Isaiah the prophet says (in chapter 40, verse 3).” And those who had been sent were from the lawyers (who most of all oppose the truth); and they asked him and said to him, “Why then do you baptize, since you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” John answered them, saying, “I baptize in water (that is, I wash with water), but among you stood One (dwelling both according to divinity and according to humanity) whom you do not know (that He is God and the Christ). He is the One who comes after me (to baptize with the Holy Spirit), He who was made before me (more worthy in dignity even in His humanity), whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loosen (that He should have sandals).” These things happened in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.  

This holy reading shows the goodness of Saint John and the wickedness of the priests; and so it teaches faithful Christians to follow the goodness of Saint John, and not to fall into priestly wickedness. John’s goodness shows itself in confessing the truth and in humility: he confessed the truth, saying what he was not, and not denying what he was; and he showed humility when he said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness!” The wickedness of the priests—both those who sent and those who were sent—shows itself in this, that Saint John’s life was hateful to them, as the reading bears witness; for they say, “Why then do you baptize?” And our Savior says in Matthew chapter 11, verse 18: “John came, neither eating,” that is, meat, “nor drinking,” namely wine, “and they say, ‘He has a devil,’” that is, in himself.  

A second thing shows their wickedness: they do not want to be satisfied with a good answer, but they press him, saying, “Why then do you baptize, since you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” Oh, how much wickedness the priests of today have, who call others—who live well—devil-men! For when they call them heretics and erring, then by that they count them as devil-men. And the Savior foretold this to His faithful in Matthew chapter 10, verse 25, saying: “Since they call the master of the house a devil-man, how much more those of his household.” And as they tried to forbid John to baptize, saying, “Why then do you baptize?” so the priests of today also forbid preaching and baptizing and serving Mass to those who lead God’s truth. They themselves do not preach the truth straightforwardly, so that people would leave off sins, and they hinder others; just as those priests did not preach God’s law, and they hindered Christ, stopping His mouth, as Luke 11:53 bears witness, and cursing those who believed in Him, as John 9:28 bears witness. The priests of today do the same, sending their messengers both from Rome and from Prague, and obtaining bulls so that they may stop preaching in chapels and burn books; as happened under Archbishop Zbyněk the priest, and as now is happening in the confusions of the Prague archbishopric. Alas! they do not listen that God says in this reading: “Make straight the way of God!” John made it straight: he himself lived well, he showed others the road to salvation, he rebuked them for sins, and by his preaching he showed them how they ought to live; therefore he said: “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness: make straight the way of God!”  

Here we should understand that Saint John humbly confessed his frailty, saying, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,” that is: I am called by Him who cries in the wilderness. And understand it this way: Saint John is God’s caller; he preaches in the wilderness, and crying out he calls the people to repentance, as Luke says in chapter 3, verse 8: “Do deeds worthy of repentance, for the kingdom of heaven has drawn near.” And that calling is done by God, who calls to repentance; God calls a human being through every creature, as Saint Augustine says in Lib. 11. Conf.: “Heaven and earth and all the things that are in heaven and on earth—behold, everywhere they tell me that I should love You, nor do they cease telling all people, so that they cannot have an excuse that they did not love God.”  

Second, God cries out in the wilderness of this world that every human being is very fragile; therefore He said to Isaiah in chapter 40, verse 6: “Cry out!” And Isaiah: “What shall I cry?” And God to him: “Every man is hay, and all his glory is like the flower of the field!” Solomon understood this, being disappointed by the vanity of the world, and he says in Eccl. ult., 12:8: “Vanity of vanities, and all things are vanity!” that is: a person who gives himself to any things whatever, abandoning God, will find nothing for himself but vanity; for all comfort from things perishes for him. Therefore it is necessary for a person to serve God diligently, and to use the things the Lord God has given him for nothing further than God’s praise and his own salvation; and thus, first of all, to know himself: who he is, what he is like, where he is, and where he will be. Who? that he is a human being created by God and redeemed by His blood. And what is he like? that because of sins he is miserable and unsteady in deeds. And where is he? that he is in a miserable world, which is a true wilderness, full of poisonous serpents, that is, priests and other evil slanderers, to whom Saint John and Christ said that they are a generation of serpents. And where will he be? woe to him if he ends up in eternal fire!  

And surely, if a person often looked into himself and knew himself, then he would be able to know God too, and many other things to his benefit. Therefore the wise wrote above the door of their school: “Know yourself!” so that whoever wants to know wisdom should begin first with himself; for whoever does not truly know himself, how can he know other things? Saint John, knowing what he is, confessed humbly that he is the voice of one crying in the wilderness; and he also knew and proclaimed the dignity of the Savior, saying: “I baptize in water,” showing that He who comes after me will baptize; but “among you” He is—both as God and also as man—whom you do not know because of your sin and because you do not understand the prophecy. He is the One who comes after me to baptize, to preach, and to teach, just as after me He began His life according to humanity, and after me He was born; “He who was made before me”—not made according to divinity, nor first created according to humanity, but He who is before me and before every human being first in dignity.  

Remember here that Christ is not “made” in divinity, and that as man He was made after Saint John, and yet in dignity He is made the foremost. And this dignity John confesses when he says: “Whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loosen.” As if he said: And what wonder is it that He is more worthy than I, whom I know was born after me, but I do not fully know the mystery of His birth? So says S. Řehoř In Om. And thus by the strap by which the sandal is bound to the foot is understood the joining of Christ’s humanity with divinity; for the Son of God took humanity upon Himself by this likeness: just as first there is a foot, and remaining a foot it takes on a sandal and is hidden under the sandal—so divinity in the person of the Son of God took humanity upon itself and divinity remained, hidden from bodily eyes under humanity. And John is not worthy to loosen that joining of divinity with humanity, as he says, confessing humbly his inability in this: “I am not worthy to loosen the strap of His sandal.”  

From these words, black brothers, the monks, argue against the barefoot ones that Christ walked in sandals like they do, saying that John would not have spoken of His sandal if He had not had it; and the barefoot ones in turn argue against them that Christ walked barefoot like they do, for otherwise Mary Magdalene could not have washed His feet with her tears at the feast. But in this quarrel neither side has a good proof; rather, sin remains with both of them, because they do not want to follow Christ’s poverty without desire for property. And so, having excessive desire for wealth, both of them have not put shoes on their feet; but Christ, who for us endured poverty, was shod in His mind against desire for temporal goods, and if He so wished, then sometimes He walked in sandals and sometimes barefoot. And I do not dare to loosen that—whether He ever walked in sandals or never walked; but it is enough for me that for me, a sinner, He walked in the world as He was pleased to do.
