title: Third Sunday of Lent
---

Jan Hus's sermon for the Third Sunday of Lent focuses on Christ's exorcism of a mute demon (Luke 11:14-28), addressing the Pharisees' accusation that Jesus casts out demons by Beelzebub's power. Hus explains Christ's five arguments against this blasphemy and warns against spiritual relapse.

- **Christ's Miraculous Power**: Jesus heals a man possessed by a mute demon, restoring speech and sight. The crowd marvels, but Pharisees accuse Him of using Beelzebub's power.
- **Five Arguments Against Blasphemy**:
  1. **Divided Kingdom**: A kingdom divided cannot stand—Satan wouldn’t destroy his own dominion (Luke 11:17-18).
  2. **Jewish Exorcists**: If Jesus used Beelzebub, why do Jewish exorcists (their "sons") cast out demons in God’s name? (Luke 11:19).
  3. **Finger of God**: Christ casts out demons by God’s Spirit, proving God’s kingdom has come (Luke 11:20).
  4. **Stronger Man**: Jesus, the "stronger man," overpowers Satan (the "strong man") and plunders his goods (Luke 11:21-22).
  5. **Alignment with Christ**: Those not with Christ scatter; Satan wouldn’t aid His mission (Luke 11:23).
- **Warning Against Relapse**: The unclean spirit returns with seven worse spirits if a repentant soul falls back into sin (Luke 11:24-26). Hus emphasizes the danger of ingratitude and spiritual complacency.
- **Blessing of Obedience**: A woman blesses Christ’s mother, but Jesus redirects praise to those who "hear God’s word and keep it" (Luke 11:27-28).

> *"Blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it."* (Luke 11:28)
