title: Reading for the Second Sunday in Advent  
---

Jan Hus's sermon for the Second Sunday in Advent focuses on Christ's second coming, contrasting His humble first arrival with His glorious and powerful return. He warns of the signs preceding Judgment Day and urges believers to remain vigilant, combining fear of divine justice with hope in redemption.

### Key Points:
1. **Christ's Two Comings**:
   - First coming: Humble, riding a donkey.
   - Second coming: Glorious, "coming in the clouds with great power" (Luke 21:27).

2. **Signs of Judgment Day**:
   - Cosmic disturbances: Darkened sun, moon, falling stars (Matthew 24:29).
   - Earthly turmoil: Wars, famines, earthquakes (Luke 21:25-26).
   - Moral decay: False prophets, corruption in the Church (Matthew 24:24).

3. **Antichrist's Deception**:
   - False teachers prioritize papal authority over Christ's teachings.
   - They sell indulgences, exploit the poor, and persecute truth-tellers.

4. **Exhortations**:
   - "Lift up your heads" (Luke 21:28): Hope for the faithful amid tribulation.
   - Prepare through repentance, holy living, and resisting evil (2 Peter 3:11-12).

5. **Final Judgment**:
   - Christ will judge with wrath for sinners but glory for the righteous (Psalm 97:3).
   - Eternal consequences: Heaven for the faithful, hell for the unrepentant (Matthew 25:46).

> **Key Quote**:  
> "Lift up your heads, for your redemption is near." (Luke 21:28)
