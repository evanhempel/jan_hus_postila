title: Twelfth Sunday After Holy Trinity
---

This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon for the Twelfth Sunday after Holy Trinity, based on Mark chapter 7, verses 31-37. The sermon explores Jesus healing a deaf and mute man, emphasizing themes of spiritual deafness, the importance of hearing God's word, and the role of faithful preachers. 

### Key Points:
1. **Jesus' Compassion and Power**
   - Jesus travels tirelessly to preach and heal, showing both divine power and human compassion.
   - The healing of the deaf and mute man demonstrates His authority over physical and spiritual infirmities.

2. **Spiritual Deafness and Muteness**
   - The man's condition symbolizes humanity's spiritual state: deaf to God's word and mute in praise due to sin.
   - Jan Hus critiques clergy and laity alike for ignoring God's commands and failing to teach or repent.

3. **The Role of Preachers**
   - Faithful preachers are scarce; many clergy are corrupt, prioritizing wealth over spiritual care.
   - Hus quotes Isaiah 56:10-11 to condemn greedy and ignorant shepherds who neglect their flock.

4. **How Sinners Are Brought to Jesus**
   - Eight means draw sinners to Christ:
     1. God's grace
     2. Hearing Scripture
     3. Suffering (illness)
     4. Fear of death
     5. Worldly adversities
     6. Godly companionship
     7. Good examples
     8. Prayer

5. **The Healing Process**
   - Jesus heals through symbolic acts: touching ears (opening spiritual hearing) and tongue (freeing speech).
   - Healing requires repentance, leaving sinful company, and receiving the Holy Spirit's gifts.

6. **Silencing and Proclaiming**
   - Jesus commands silence about the miracle to avoid misunderstanding His divinity.
   - Despite this, the healed man proclaims God's works, showing gratitude.
