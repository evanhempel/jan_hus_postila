This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon on Luke 2:42-52, focusing on Jesus at age 12 in the temple. Hus uses this passage to teach about obedience to God over human authority, the duties of clergy, and spiritual growth.

- **Jesus’ Example in the Temple**:
  1. At 12, Jesus stays behind in the temple to teach, prioritizing God’s work over familial expectations.
  2. He listens and questions the teachers, demonstrating wisdom—a model for clergy who should prioritize study over worldly distractions.
- **Critique of Clergy**:
  - Hus condemns corrupt priests who neglect teaching for taverns, dancing, or greed.
  - Warns against blind obedience to human authorities (like the Pope) over God’s commands, citing historical papal errors.
- **Obedience to God vs. Humans**:
  - Children should honor parents but obey God first (e.g., if called to celibacy over marriage).
  - Hus rejects the claim that obeying a superior’s evil order absolves the subordinate of sin (Matthew 15:14: "If the blind lead the blind, both fall into a pit").
- **Mary’s Role**:
  - She treasured Jesus’ words in her heart, exemplifying how believers should internalize Scripture.
  - Spiritual motherhood (doing God’s will) surpasses physical ties to Christ (Luke 11:28).
- **Jesus’ Growth**:
  - He advanced in "wisdom, stature, and favor with God and man," showing gradual revelation of His divinity.

> **Key Quote**:  
> *"Blest are they who hear God’s word and keep it"* (Luke 11:28).
