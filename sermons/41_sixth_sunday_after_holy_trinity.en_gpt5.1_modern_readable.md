# Sixth Sunday After Holy Trinity  
Matthew 5:20–24

At that time Jesus said to his disciples: “Truly I tell you: unless your righteousness is greater than that of the teachers and the scribes, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. You have heard that it was said to the people of old: ‘You shall not kill; and whoever kills will be liable to judgment.’ But I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother without good reason will be liable to judgment; and whoever says to his brother, ‘Racha!’ will be liable to condemnation; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the fire of hell. So if you are bringing your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. Go first and make peace with your brother; then come and offer your gift.”

**A.**

Our merciful Savior, wanting to lead his disciples into true love—the love by which the kingdom of heaven is opened—teaches them not even to be wrongly angry with their brothers, not to provoke them with evil, not to insult them, and in this way certainly not to kill them.

But if it does happen that someone has done wrong against a brother, the Savior commands that whenever he remembers it, he must not offer anything to God unless he first makes peace with the one he has wronged.

Because the teachers and scribes did not keep this, the Savior says to his disciples—and so to all Christians: “Truly I tell you: unless your righteousness is greater than that of the teachers and the scribes, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.”

Know this: the “teachers” were those who explained God’s law to the people, telling them how to understand it. The “scribes” were those who set themselves apart from the common people with a special way of life: special clothes and special customs. Even in our time there are these two groups—teachers and scribes—and may God grant that they are not worse than those of old.

They opposed our merciful Savior more than anyone else. That is why Christ called them a “brood of vipers,” “sons of the devil,” “hypocrites,” “an unbelieving and adulterous generation,” and the very worst of people.

He called them hypocrites because they appeared righteous in front of people and acted as if they were righteous—but they were not. Therefore the Savior says to his disciples: “Truly I tell you: unless your righteousness is greater than that of the teachers and scribes, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.”

**B.**

Understand what righteousness is. Righteousness is the virtue by which a person gives each one what belongs to them.

So when a person gives God what belongs to God—that is, glory, honor, and obedience, keeping all his commandments—then that person is righteous toward God.

And because no one can truly be righteous toward God without also being righteous toward their neighbor, a righteous person also gives their neighbor what belongs to them.

And what belongs to our neighbor? That we love them as ourselves, desire good for them as for ourselves, and do them no injustice. So we do not become wrongly angry with them, we do not say to them “Racha!” or “You fool!” out of malice. Then we are righteous toward our neighbor.

But the teachers and scribes were not like this toward the Lord Jesus. They did not honor him as God. They did not keep his commandments. They did not love him even as a neighbor. Instead they became angry with him for no reason and hissed at him: “Fool, drunkard, glutton, demon-possessed, Samaritan, deceiver, blasphemer,” and said that he was not from God because he did not keep their feast days.

So they were unrighteous both toward God and toward their neighbor.

And because they taught the people only this: “Do not kill,” without forbidding them to be angry, therefore they were unrighteous before God both in their actions and in their teaching, even though they seemed righteous before people.

Therefore the Savior exposes their unrighteousness, wanting his disciples to be righteous. He says: “Truly I tell you: unless your righteousness is greater than that of the teachers and scribes, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.”

Their righteousness was mistaken. They believed that only the evil outward deed was a mortal sin and a breaking of God’s commandment, and that an evil thought was not a mortal sin. But the righteousness of Christ’s disciples must be such that they also avoid evil thoughts.

So he goes on: “You have heard that it was said to the people of old, ‘You shall not kill; and whoever kills will be liable to judgment.’ But I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment.”

**C.**

Know that killing a person can sometimes be good and sometimes evil.

It is good when, by God’s command, according to proper order and in love, a judge, or the community, or some other authority puts an evil person to death. For God says in Leviticus 24:16: “Whoever curses God must be put to death.”

And when Scripture says: “It was said to those of old: ‘You shall not kill; and whoever kills will be liable to judgment,’” it is speaking of Exodus 20:13: “You shall not kill”—and whoever kills shall be condemned to death. For God says in Leviticus 24:17 and 19–20: “Whoever strikes a person so that they die must be put to death. Whoever injures his fellow citizen—as he has done, it shall be done to him: fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As he has caused a blemish, so it shall be inflicted on him; he will be compelled to suffer it.”

Against this clear command of God stand almost all princes, lords, and townsmen who let murderers go free for money, taking the money for themselves or accepting payment to delay the sentence.

Where did they learn that a murderer may pay a sum of money instead of dying? In some lands they have fixed prices: for a peasant’s life, five *kops* of coins. Is a human being so cheap—one who is worth more than the whole world?

Where did they learn to value a townsman’s life as worth more—ten *kops* or five *kops* more than a peasant’s? And a squire more expensive by forty *kops* than a townsman? And a lord worth fifty more than a squire?

God values a better person more highly. Suppose a simple peasant is holy, and a lord kills him without cause, like Cain killed Abel. And suppose a wicked squire is killed by another wicked man. Will not the Lord God value that holy peasant far more than the wicked squire?

Also, I do not know where judges learned to assign “penance” to a murderer by saying he should go—or hire someone else to go—to Rome or Aachen for the one he murdered by injustice. Why do they not judge as God has commanded, who says in Leviticus 24:17, “Whoever kills a person must be put to death”?

In 1 Kings 20:42 we read that the prophet said to the king of Israel, Ahab, after he had released Ben-Hadad king of Syria: “This is what the Lord says: Because you have let a man go out of your hand whom I had appointed to destruction, your life will be in exchange for his life, and your people for his people.” And that is what happened: Ahab was killed and his people were slaughtered.

Again, because King Saul did not kill Agag, king of the Amalekites (1 Samuel 15:9), God took the kingdom away from him, and later he was killed by pagans.

So how can today’s judges not be sinning when they unjustly release murderers for money or out of favoritism, though God says in Exodus 20:13, “You shall not kill”—that is, you shall not unjustly and without cause kill a person—“for whoever kills will be liable to judgment,” meaning he must be condemned according to the Scripture of God, which says in Exodus 21:12: “Whoever strikes a person so that they die must be put to death.”

**D.**

We must take this commandment “You shall not kill” very seriously, so that we do not destroy a person’s life in any way—not by our own hand, not by our advice, not by urging another to do it, not by poisoning, not by unjust sentencing, not by failing to defend someone when we are able to defend them.

We must not be guilty of killing anyone even by agreeing to the killing of an innocent person, or by seizing their property in such a way that they die of hunger, or by withholding alms.

Saint Ambrose says: “Feed the hungry with your bread. If you did not feed him and he died of hunger, you have killed him”—that is, if he died, your neglect killed him.

And Saint Paul writes to the Romans (14:15): “Do not destroy with your food the one for whom Christ died.” By this he means, as he explains there, that we must not lead someone into destruction by our bad example—for that person is one for whom Christ died.

To kill a soul by sin is worse than to kill a body.

Therefore a person must be very careful not to kill anyone’s soul by false teaching, evil advice, bad example, or neglecting to give good instruction.

Saint Gregory says that as many people as we destroy by bad example or neglect, so many times are we worthy of death.

And if you do not want to believe Gregory, then believe Christ, who says in Matthew 18:6: “Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a millstone for a donkey hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.”

O dear Christ! If everyone who misleads others by a bad example were drowned like that, there would be very few priests and scribes left—starting from the pope down to the lowest one who is devoted to greed, pride, and sexual sin.

And what would become of all the whoring priests and monks—and we have no sea? Perhaps with their women they would all have to be drowned in the millponds with millstones at the stream, and the stream would be stopped and turned into a lake!

Lord Christ, grant that, without being drowned in their bodies, they may repent together with their mistresses, so that they will not be plunged forever into hell.

Grant also, dear Christ, that by listening to you we may all truly keep this commandment: “You shall not kill.”

**E.**

Christ goes on: “But I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment.”

Understand that there is a good anger, which we are required to have—or else we will be in danger of eternal condemnation. For God says in Ephesians 4:26: “Be angry”—that is, be angry at sin—“and do not sin.”

Therefore Saint John Chrysostom says in *De op. imperf. hom. 11*: “Sometimes we become angry in a right and loving way. For if there is no anger against sins, teaching will not be effective, judgments will not help, and sins will not be restrained. Righteous anger is therefore the mother of obedience. So not only does a person not sin when he is angry for a right reason, but he earns a reward. If he does not get angry in such a case, he sins. For foolish softness spreads sins, neglect feeds them, and it calls not only evil people but even good people into evil.” So far Chrysostom.

The second kind of anger is evil. It is a disorderly desire for revenge. So when a person, without good cause, desires some kind of revenge against his neighbor, that is anger. And even if the other person is guilty, yet this one takes revenge into his own hands, then again he is guilty of sinful anger and breaks God’s commandment and is worthy of judgment.

Therefore the Savior says: “But I tell you”—not only that you must not kill—“but that everyone who is angry with his brother is liable to judgment,” meaning, he must be judged worthy of eternal condemnation.

Know this also: if you are angry at someone because of their sin, and you are not knowingly living in mortal sin yourself, then in truth you love that person. But if you are not angry at their sin, then you do not love them—and certainly not if you draw them into sin or agree with them in it.

So know this: you must love the person who is evil, but you must not love his evil. Therefore, value God’s creature rightly and love that—that is, the person—and recognize sin with your understanding, and do not love it but rather be angry at it.

In this way you will understand, as Saint Augustine says, that it is one thing to be angry at your brother and another thing to be angry at sin, and that the one who is angry at sin is not angry at his brother.

But you might say: “Since evil anger is a disorderly desire for revenge, then it must not be right to desire punishment even for a guilty brother.”

Know that in desiring punishment one can go astray in many ways.

First, if someone desires punishment for an innocent person.  
Second, if he desires punishment outside the order God has established.  
Third, if he desires it for his own private revenge or his own glory.

For every such kind of anger a person is worthy of judgment.

Christ goes on: “And whoever says to his brother, ‘Racha!’ will be liable to condemnation.”

Know that *racha*, as Saint Jerome says, is a Hebrew word. Spoken in anger it means something like “empty-head.” Saint Augustine adds that *racha* is a sign by which a person shows the anger in his heart—like rolling his eyes, twisting his nose, or curling his lips.

So whenever someone shows his anger with such signs—saying things like “Bah!” or “Idiot!” or anything like that, or flashing angry looks with his eyes, or sticking out his tongue, twisting his mouth, or making a mocking face or gesture at someone—then he is, as it were, saying to his brother, “Racha!” and is liable to condemnation.

The Savior goes on: “And whoever says, ‘You fool!’”—to his brother, that is, to any neighbor—“will be liable to the fire of hell,” when he says it out of anger in order to insult him.

Those who insult others must weigh this carefully. Especially priests and scholars who, fighting over church positions, write against one another every insult they can think of.

The same applies to all those who write terrible insults about others because they have not paid their debts, and to everyone who slanders others.

If the one who says to his brother out of malice, “You fool,” is worthy of eternal fire, how much more those who call their neighbor a heretic without truly knowing any heresy in him—and especially if they do it out of envy because he exposes their sins, just as the priests and scribes called Christ a deceiver and heretic.

We should also notice how in this passage Christ sets out three steps of sin:

1. First step: anger only in the heart.  
2. Second: anger in the heart with some outward sign.  
3. Third: anger with spoken or written insults.

So a person first has anger in the heart, then shows it with a sign, then expresses it in understandable speech or in writing.

The first step is a great sin, the second greater, the third greatest.

Likewise Christ sets out three degrees of punishment: judgment, condemnation, and eternal fire. By these three he indicates the torments of hell: first a person will be judged, second condemned, and third tortured by fire. Judgment will be severe, condemnation more severe, and suffering in the fire the most severe of all.

Every unrepentant person will suffer this threefold punishment for every mortal sin, though one sinner will suffer more than another.

Because a person can repent of each of these three stages of sin, and can also avoid them, Christ says: “will be liable to judgment,” “will be liable to condemnation,” “will be liable to the fire of hell.” He does not say “is already condemned,” unless he dies without repentance.

For no sinner, while he is sinning in thought, word, or deed, is finally damned unless he finally refuses to repent.

Therefore, if a person is to have a righteousness greater than that of the teachers and scribes, he must hold love for his neighbor in his heart, in his words, and in his deeds. And if he has wronged anyone, he must humbly make it right.

And because all works without love are worthless before God, a person must first be in love and then do other works.

Therefore Christ continues: “If you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar; go first to be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.”

**G.**

In every work we do, we must consider three things: the glory of God, the good of our neighbor, and our own reward.

Although we must first look to God’s glory, yet our merciful Lord does not want glory from us without our benefit and the benefit of our neighbor.

Therefore Saint John Chrysostom says: “Look at the mercy of God. He seeks human benefit more than his own praise. He loves unity among Christians more than his gifts.” That is why he says: “If you bring your gift to the altar,” and so on.

From this you see that no offering is pleasing to God without love.

We priests must take this seriously, so that we do not go up to the altar when we have any mortal sin in us—especially anger in our heart, resentment of our neighbor, and insult spoken out of malice.

The Savior says: “If you bring your gift”—that is, if in your heart you intend to bring any offering to God or to do any good work—“and there remember that your brother”—whoever he is—“has something against you,” meaning that you have wronged him, “leave your gift there”—that is, do not offer it or do that work—“and go first; humble yourself to your brother,” that is, first make it right with God and your neighbor.

For when you are reconciled to God and your brother, you will have God and your brother on your side, so that you may rightly offer any good work to God. Therefore the Savior says: “Then come and offer your gift”—that is, then you will offer your good work worthily.

Look, you have here a sure Bishop—Jesus—who does not say: “Give to me, and I will absolve you from what you did against your brother.” No—he does not want to receive anything from you unless you first lay it aside and make peace with your brother.

But priests today often do the opposite: many want to be paid first, and only then tell you to make it right with your brother—or they say, “I absolve you from that!”

**H.**

You might say: “The brother I wronged has died.”  
Or: “I don’t know where he is.”  
Or: “He doesn’t want reconciliation.”  
Or: “I dare not show myself to him.”  
Or: “I am not able to make full restitution.”

Know that the Savior does not burden anyone with what is impossible. Christ means that a person must make things right with his neighbor when he can reasonably do so, so that his neighbor does not suffer loss, and also when he sees that his neighbor will not be stirred up to more evil by it.

To the first objection, that your brother has died, I answer: God is alive, and above all you must humble yourself before him. If you have done wrong to your brother’s property and you are able to repay it, then you must give it to his children or his relatives.

If you do not know where he is, or he is far away so that you cannot reasonably go to him, the case is similar.

If, as in the third case, he will not listen or accept restitution, then you are no longer guilty before him—unless later he is willing to accept it; in that case you must still be willing to make it right.

Fourth, if you dare not reveal your sin to him because much evil could come from your confession, then you must act prudently, perhaps through other people—like if you stole something, you must secretly return the thing itself or the same amount. But if the wrong is different—for example, that you defiled his daughter or his wife—then you must keep silent about it, humble yourself before God, and do penance for the sin.

Fifth, if you truly cannot make full restitution, that explains itself. You must entrust it to God, for every sin must first of all be dealt with before him. He is the one we first offend in every sin, and then we offend each of his creatures. No one can truly make it right with God unless he makes it right with every creature he has wronged when it is possible.

Therefore a person must not believe priests and scribes when they say that he can make restitution to them with money as they demand in confession.

**I.**

You must know that the chief and most acceptable work of satisfaction for a sinner is to have a broken heart. David says in Psalm 51:19: “The sacrifice to God is a troubled spirit; a broken and humbled heart.”

This sacrifice, offered spiritually on the altar of the soul, helps the sinner and the whole holy church more than a bodily sacrifice laid on the stone altar in the church.

For since a person, by his sin, has sinned against God, he has also sinned against the whole holy church by cutting off in himself the help he should give to it. Therefore he must make things right with the holy church by returning to it, so that the saints in heaven may rejoice and those on earth and in purgatory may receive help.

Let us learn to offer rightly.

First, by guarding ourselves from sin.  
But if we have sinned, let us immediately offer to God, on the inner altar, a troubled spirit and a humble heart—concerning this altar God says in Leviticus 6:13: “The fire will burn on my altar; it must never go out.”

That fire is love for God and neighbor, and it must never be extinguished in the soul.

About this fire the Savior says in Luke 12:49: “I came to cast fire upon the earth, and what do I desire but that it be kindled?”—that is, that hearts burn with that fire.

To this fire, as God says, the priest must constantly add fuel so that it keeps burning. Where will we find a better priest to keep this fire in us than Jesus, our great High Priest? He teaches us to have a righteousness greater than that of the teachers and scribes, not to kill anyone, not to be angry without cause, not to show signs of anger, not to insult our brother—and if we have wronged anyone, to make it right and then offer our sacrifice, that is, our good work, to God on the altar of the soul.

The first sacrifice: heartfelt sorrow for sin.  
The second: love for God.  
The third: prayer.  
The fourth: works of mercy toward our neighbor.  
The fifth: perseverance in what is good.

Whoever offers these sacrifices to God does not appear before him empty-handed. For God says in Exodus 23:15: “You shall not appear before me empty.”

Priests often twist this onto their own scale and explain it this way: “You shall not come to church without an offering, but with an offering at the altar.” I know this: it is good when people give offerings. But we do wrong when we greedily demand offerings.

May our merciful Savior grant that we do as he has commanded us in this passage. Amen.
