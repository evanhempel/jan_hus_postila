title: "Addendum: Another Sermon on Reading 46 (Thirteenth Sunday after Holy Trinity)"
---

This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon, which explores the parable of the Good Samaritan from the Gospel of Luke, chapter 10, verses 30-37. Hus uses this parable to discuss the fall of humanity through Adam and Eve, the consequences of sin, and Christ's role as the ultimate Samaritan who heals and redeems.

### Key Points:
1. **The Parable's Lesson**: Hus emphasizes the commandment to love God and neighbor, citing Luke 10:27.
2. **Spiritual Interpretation**: 
   - The man who fell among thieves symbolizes Adam and all humanity, who fell from grace into sin.
   - Jericho represents the world’s instability, and the thieves symbolize the devil and sin.
3. **The Fall of Adam and Eve**:
   - Their disobedience led to humanity's spiritual death and separation from God.
   - Hus narrates their temptation, sin, and the consequences, including physical and spiritual suffering.
4. **Christ as the Samaritan**:
   - Christ is the Good Samaritan who heals humanity's wounds caused by sin.
   - By becoming human and dying on the cross, Christ restores what Adam lost.
5. **The Church's Role**: Hus calls the Church to care for the spiritually wounded, following Christ’s example of mercy and redemption.

### Key Quote:
> "Aj slyšíme teď slavné spasitele svého naučenie, slyšíme své oblúpenie, raněnie, pád i umořenie. A slyšme také veliké spasitele milosrdenstvie, že chtěl se tak, jsa bohem, ponížiti v člověčenstvie, aby navrátil na kříži, co ztratil Adam u dřeva v ráji."  
> *("Behold, we now hear the glorious teaching of our Savior, we hear of our being robbed, wounded, fallen, and killed. And let us hear also the great mercy of the Savior, who, being God, humbled himself into humanity to restore on the cross what Adam lost at the tree in paradise.")*
