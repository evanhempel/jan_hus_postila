This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon on John 1:19-26, focusing on John the Baptist's humility and the hypocrisy of the priests. Hus contrasts John's truthful confession with the priests' hostility toward God's messengers.

- **John the Baptist's humility**  
  1. Confessed truthfully what he was not (Christ, Elijah, or the prophet)  
  2. Called himself "the voice of one crying in the wilderness" (John 1:23)  
  3. Acknowledged Christ's superiority: "I am not worthy to untie His sandal strap"  

- **Priests' hypocrisy**  
  - Hated John's preaching, just as they oppose truthful preachers today  
  - Rejected Christ's authority (Luke 11:53) and persecuted believers (John 9:28)  
  - Modern priests similarly suppress truth—burning books and silencing preachers  

- **Lessons for believers**  
  - Recognize human frailty: "All flesh is grass" (Isaiah 40:6)  
  - Self-examination leads to knowing God: "Know thyself"  
  - Serve God humbly, using earthly goods only for His glory  

**Key quote**:  
> *"I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Make straight the way of the Lord!’"* (John 1:23)
