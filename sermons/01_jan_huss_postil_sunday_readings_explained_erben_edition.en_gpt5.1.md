COMENIUS EVANGELICAL FACULTY OF THEOLOGY  
IN PRAGUE

The Comenius Faculty is beginning, with this volume, an extensive selection from the literary work of Master Jan Hus, planned for about 8–10 volumes, which is meant to replace the similar selection by V. Flajšhans and Milan Svoboda that appeared not quite half a century ago and has long since disappeared from the market. Just as that selection did not aim to present Hus’s writings in a critical edition or to compete thereby with the task and program of the Commission for the Publication of Sources for the History of the Religious Movement in Bohemia in the 14th and 15th Centuries at the Czech Academy, which from 1903 to 1920 issued four volumes of Hus’s works in the labors of V. Flajšhans and V. Novotný, so our edition has no such intention either. Our aim is to make the Master’s chief writings accessible to a broad public: the Latin works in translation, the Czech ones in transcription. In this we shall depart from Flajšhans, who translated Hus into modern Czech, and we shall take as our model K. J. Erben, whose edition of Hus’s Czech writings will be our foundation. A critical edition of these writings is today even further from realization than it was in the sixties of the 19th century, and that because of the number and the divergences of the manuscripts in which they have been preserved. Erben therefore took as his basis the best manuscript and passed over the variant readings of the others, and the text he thus constructed is in substance still satisfactory today. Our edition thus renews the attempt of the young F. Žilka, later a professor and an ornament of our faculty, namely his reworking of Erben’s edition from 1902. The editor himself speaks about the details of our editorial adjustments in the afterword.

We intend first to publish the Czech works, in whose case the need for a new edition appears most urgent. Compared with the Latin writings, which are mostly earlier and far more numerous, there are far fewer Czech ones, but they have a great advantage over them. Whereas the Latin works are written for the clergy or for the educated classes who have passed through the university, Master Jan wrote the Czech works for the common people. Many of them were created in exile, outside Prague, and Hus wrote them just as much for his new hearers in the countryside as for the hearers in Bethlehem Chapel from whom he had been torn away, yet with whom he remained intimately bound until the tragic end of his life. He remembered them gratefully even when face to face with death and sent them greetings as his doctors, those tailors, shoemakers, and scribes from whom he did not hesitate to learn no less than from his university teachers. Hus’s Czech works also form the basis of his fame as a classic not only of the Czech Reformation but of our literature as a whole. They therefore already have a splendid tradition in the history of our nation and have exercised a mighty influence on whole generations of it. Let us recall a testimony that, more than many others, captures the moral strength with which they are charged, and that has quite exceptional weight already by reason of the personality of its author. It is Z. Nejedlý. “Already as a boy,” he confessed in 1919 in the booklet Hus and His Truth, “I got into my hands Erben’s edition of Hus’s writings, and not only did I read them at once and with relish, but from that time on they became perhaps my dearest book, a book with which I have never again parted. In every period of my life I have read in these three volumes as in my best gospel, in which I found for all the questions that ever pressed upon me an answer, and that an answer that set me free. From them I learned to honor the duties of life, to grasp the meaning of the struggle for truth, to understand the moral duties of man, and also so many other things that only make a man into a true human being. But even when I suffered from quite special, period-conditioned doubts, I always found the best support in Hus’s writings. And so in these last past years of deepest oppression and humiliation I again opened these books and found in them passages that might just as well have been written today, for our people of today.” So much Z. Nejedlý.

We begin the selection with the Czech Postil, Hus’s most mature work, as even Master Jan’s strict Catholic judge Jan Sedlák himself acknowledged. It is his last great work, completed in exile at Kozí Hrádek on October 27, 1413, and it is the conclusion of his many years of preaching activity, in which this activity reaches its climax. For twelve years of his work in Prague, from his ordination to the priesthood in the summer of 1400 until his departure into exile in October 1412, Hus was a zealous preacher, who also published his sermons. Already in the first year of his preaching he gathered the harvest of that year into a collection, and when in March 1402 he came to the pulpit of Bethlehem Chapel, he apparently did so nearly every year thereafter; from the last five years we have such a postil from each year, and from the earlier six at least three for now, and beside these yet another special collection of sermons for feast days. As the years go on, the postils grow in scope and value. One postil stands out from them especially: the great postil of 1410–1411, the so‑called Bethlehem Sermons. This postil, written, like all those mentioned, in Latin, seems to have been Hus’s main aid when, sometime in the summer of 1413, perhaps still in Prague, where he was kept until July by attempts of the royal court to reconcile him with the Church, he decided to rework those Latin sermons into our Postil. He was then probably quite disturbed in his work by his preaching activity, which he carried on in the wide surroundings of his place of refuge, Kozí Hrádek near what later became Tábor. Only the autumn allowed him to complete the work.

Hus adhered to his Latin originals in places almost word for word—this especially where he did not have enough time—yet the Czech Postil still has a markedly different character. The Latin postils usually provide only bare sketches or outlines and are written in an almost shorthand style. They are written for priests, and we often find here the instruction: “Develop this as best you can!” Our Postil is written for the people. It therefore adds what Hus for the most part suppressed in the Latin collections: reflections and personal recollections. These are in many places defensive in character, but also offensive. This is the reflection of the struggle out of which the work arose and which, at the time it was written, was reaching its climax. From October 1412 Hus had already been a proscribed man. He had been solemnly excommunicated and struck by the Church’s curse already in 1410, but the protection of King Wenceslas IV caused that great blow to remain on paper. However, Hus’s attack on the trafficking in indulgences in June 1412 so angered the capricious monarch that he turned away from Hus forever, and Hus had no choice but to leave Prague. Street riots broke out there, for the Church could now proceed to carry out the excommunication to its final consequences: to stop in the capital any kind of divine service, burials, and baptisms. Death itself threatened Hus personally, and the royal court, as he himself recalls in the Postil, pressed him to leave Prague. He returned to Bethlehem Chapel later about twice more, but only in secret, and around July he left the city for good. By then Hus’s party already had its martyrs, not only in Prague, where three young adherents of the Master fell by the hand of the executioner in the riots against the indulgences, but also in Moravia. It is certainly no wonder that the recollections of all this color the Postil with bitterness and indignation, and that among the calm expositions of biblical texts we read again and again defenses of his own conduct against his opponents, whether it be the now deceased Archbishop Zbyněk of Hazmburk, the doctors of the theological faculty led by Hus’s old teacher Stanislav of Znojmo, or the popes; indeed, once we even read here a several‑page defensive exposition on excommunication. The theologian yields here to the fighter, and the Postil gives us the possibility of picturing Hus in the pulpit as he truly preached and fought. He fights not only for himself, but also for his dear Bethlehem Chapel when the church is struck with interdict because spiritual hymns are sung there during the services. All this gives the Postil a vividness that not a single one of Hus’s numerous Latin postils attains.

Yet this is not the work’s only merit. No less important is how beautifully it mirrors Hus’s program of reform in its final form and maturity. Hus in essence took over this program from an older generation of preachers, from the school of Milíč, but he both gave it a more scholarly armament and also thought it through in various ways. He took that “armament” mostly from his leading teacher John Wyclif. The further development he carried out chiefly by returning to the very Father of our Reformation, Milíč, especially to his uncompromising ideal of priestly poverty after the example of Christ. Whereas Milíč for the most part contented himself with proclaiming this ideal by his own life, Hus made it into a norm not only for himself but for all clergy, and, like Wyclif, he declared any deviation from this norm to be simony and thereby heresy. Fees for the administration of the sacraments (and in those days one paid even for confession) are, according to Hus, simony, and all the property of the Church belongs to the poor; priests have a right only to food and clothing. In this way the Bethlehem preacher was cutting away the whole economic power of the clergy, which rested on an enormous landed wealth that made the Church the greatest landowner in the country, and he was already justifying what the Hussite revolution would later carry out: the confiscation of Church estates and thereby a far‑reaching social revolution. For these estates are that poison which, according to medieval legend, was poured into the Church when it received property from Emperor Constantine and which poisoned all Christendom with quarrels and disputes among priests, with simony, pride, and fornication. And so Hus does not hesitate to repeat after Wyclif: “Dogs fight over a bone; take away the bone and they will stop!” This was a call to the state, a call to revolution. The Church answered it by redoubling its efforts to get the accursed heretic into its hands and make him forever harmless.

When he had come almost halfway through the work, Hus still did not believe that his exile would be the final solution of his defiance against the Church. If it be God’s will, he says (p. 198), he will yet dare to disregard the excommunication pronounced over him when he sees the right time for it and will preach again; by this he probably means preaching in Bethlehem Chapel. A little later (p. 211) he gives expression to this hope in the famous motto from Scripture that will become the slogan of the revolution: Truth overcomes all things and stands firm forever. This hope did not leave him even when he finished the work at the end of October 1413. Four days later King Sigismund arranged in Italy with Pope John XXIII the summoning of the Council of Constance, and this brought about in Hus’s case a change of fateful scope. With the general council of the Church there appeared on the stage a judge far more powerful than the pope, because he was seemingly completely impartial, and Hus was quickly deprived of any possibility of resisting him, as he had resisted obeying the pope’s order. Now the whole of Europe was set in motion to force Hus’s surrender to be tried by the council. Not even a year had passed since the completion of the Postil in the quiet castle of Kozí Hrádek, and Master Jan was on his way to Constance, on a journey from which there was no return.
