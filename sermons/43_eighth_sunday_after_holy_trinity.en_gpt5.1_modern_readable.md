# Eighth Sunday After Holy Trinity

At that time Jesus said (Matthew 7:15–21): “Watch out. Be on your guard against false prophets, who live wickedly and preach lies. They come to you dressed like sheep — that is, under the Christian name, in priestly office, and with smooth, sweet words — but inside, in their intention, they are hungry wolves, devouring people’s honor and possessions. You will recognize them by their fruits, that is, by their deeds. Do people gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles? In the same way every good tree — that is, every good person — produces good fruit, good works; and every bad tree, every evil person, produces bad fruit, evil works. A good tree cannot, as long as it is good, bear bad fruit; and a bad tree cannot, as long as it is bad, bear good fruit. Every tree — every person — that finally does not bear good fruit will be cut off from Christ’s orchard, the fellowship of the saints, and thrown into the eternal fire. So then, because they are a bad tree, you will know them at last by their fruits, by their works. Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven — that one will enter the kingdom of heaven.”

The merciful Savior, who knows all things past and future, and who is infinitely good, full of love for His chosen ones, warns them ahead of time about coming dangers that might strike them through false prophets. About these He says that they are hypocrites, that they are greedy, ravenous wolves in sheep’s clothing: they come in the Christian name, wearing priestly dignity, speaking with sweet words. And they are hungry wolves for this reason: the final goal they labor for, the thing they stand upon, the thing they circle around, is money. So prelates, preachers, priests, monks, and lawyers who carry the Christian name and hold offices that rightly belong to Christ’s sheep, and yet in many ways chase after greed and seize people’s property — all such people are false prophets, because one thing shows in their actions and another in their name and office. Outwardly they look like shepherds; inwardly their desire is covetousness.

Origen says: “Those were false prophets at first who opposed the true prophets, persecuting them even to death — Jeremiah, Micaiah, and many other prophets. But who are the false prophets and false Christians now? They are those who, without mercy, drive away and oppress true Christians, and whenever they can, kill them with the sword, or kill them by their wicked habits and examples.” So far Origen.

Saint Ambrose says this: “These words can be understood of all who promise one thing by their outward appearance and speech, but show another by their deeds.”

Saint John Chrysostom says: “All Christians are called ‘anointed’ — to kingship, to priesthood, and to prophecy, that is, to proclaiming God’s word — because no one can truly explain prophetic intentions unless he has the Spirit of prophecy.” I say this so you may understand that the “prophets” Christ speaks of here are teachers, that is, those who set themselves up as doctors of the soul. So far the Golden Mouth.

From these three great teachers you should understand that, in this reading, “false prophets” means heretical teachers and wicked, false Christians, especially those who, under the name of holiness and under Christ’s name, devour human wealth.

From such people Christ commands us to guard ourselves carefully.

First, so that we are not led astray from following Him.

Second, because their close company corrupts others.

Third, because it is not only their robbery and plundering that harms people, but also others agreeing to that robbery.

And fourth, because their hidden wickedness greatly damages faithful Christians when believers do not watch out for it.

Therefore the Savior says: “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing,” as if they were Christ’s sheep, “but inside they are ravenous wolves.” That is, their intention is greedy — to plunder and bend people to their own will.

And we truly do need to beware carefully. Christ says in Matthew 24:5: “Many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray.” And again, in Matthew 24:24: “False Christs and false prophets will arise, and they will give great signs and wonders.”

Who are the false Christs? Every person who lives wickedly and yet claims to be the highest anointed priest, says he has equal power on earth with Christ, and can establish whatever he wants above Christ’s law — and then change it again. In this way he leads many astray. Such a man has many false prophets roaming the world to devour and seize human wealth.

Christ commands us to recognize them — not by their clothing, but by their fruits, their deeds. For a person is like a plant, and his deed is like fruit, growing from the inner sap and root of the tree. In the same way, a deed has its root inside a person, in his understanding and in his desire. If the understanding is sound and the desire is good, then the deed will be good for salvation; but if the desire is evil, the deed will be evil.

Because false prophets outwardly have the appearance of sheep, Christ commands us to know them by their deeds, just as the quality of a tree must be known by its fruit — not by its leaves, not by its bark, not by its great height.

If we are diligent in this kind of discernment, we will see the fruit that comes from prelates.

Their fruit is this: they heap curses on those who preach the truth and on those who refuse to obey their evil commands, or do not give them what they demand, or offend them even in small things. Their fruit ought to be blessing, but instead it is a worm‑eaten cursing which displeases the Lord Jesus.

Second, their fruit is this: they shut down and forbid the services of God, when they should be multiplying and encouraging them.

Third, their fruit is piling up wealth by greed and by *simony* — buying and selling holy things.

Fourth, their fruit is sexual immorality, by which they are deeply worm‑eaten.

These four fruits they bear and produce openly, so that they are clearly recognized, even by very simple people. For the dear Savior says: “You will recognize them by their fruits.” He does not say “by their fruit,” as if by only one, but “by their fruits,” meaning many. Their many deeds show that they are not Christ’s sheep like the apostles, but hungry wolves, harmful to Christ’s flock, from whom we must keep careful watch.

So first, when they curse unjustly, do not be afraid, as though their cursing could harm your salvation.

Second, do not believe them, except where holy Scripture commands and commends something, and where sound reason agrees, so that you do nothing against God because of their teaching or their orders.

Third, do not imitate them in their wicked deeds.

Fourth, when they are openly living in sin, do not hand over your goods to them.

For as a certain worthy papal decree says: if people know for sure that a priest has a wife or a concubine, they are not to hear his mass, and if they do they fall under a curse. Not because Christ’s body is not truly present on the altar, but so that the priest, ashamed, will stop serving so disgracefully; so that, like Judas, he does not receive Christ’s body unworthily and sin the same sin as Judas, but instead leaves his harlot and returns to repentance.

So Christ’s sheep, knowing false prophets by their fruits, must guard themselves from them, so they are not deceived and led into sin. For such men are thorns that strip the wool off Christ’s little lambs, and thistles that tear Solomon’s royal garments, that is, the robe of wisdom and righteousness.

Therefore people do not gather grapes from such thorns — grapes that could yield wine to gladden the souls of the faithful. Nor do they gather figs from such thistles — figs whose sweetness and richness, that is, the abundance of love, could feed their souls. That is why the Savior asks: “Do people gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?” As if He said: “Not at all.” In the same way, from people who are useless thorns and thistles, others will find no true spiritual comfort and no sweetness.

Then He adds: “So it is that every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.” That is: every good person does good works, and every evil person does evil works. The good person practices humility, love, faith, hope, and other works of mercy. The evil person practices pride, envy, unbelief, immorality, greed, and other evil works.

Christ proves this, saying: “A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.” That is: a person who is truly good cannot, while he is good, do acts of mortal evil; and a person who is truly evil cannot, while he remains evil, do works that are truly virtuous and pleasing to God.

Because these false prophets are bad trees, thorns and not grapevines, thistles and not fig trees, they cannot bring forth good fruit. They can give no wine to cheer the hearts of the faithful, no figs to bring sweetness into the soul in loving God and neighbor.

And since they do not bear good fruit, each such person, as an evil tree, must be cut out of Christ’s orchard and thrown into the fire. Therefore Christ says: “Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down” — that is, when the owner of the tree decides — “and thrown into the fire.” In the same way, every such false prophet will be cut out of the holy community by that sentence of the Lord: “Go, you cursed, into the eternal fire!” — and so will be cast into the fire forever.

Thus our dear Christ has laid it down that we must know them by their fruits, and He has shown that in them there is no wine, because they are thorns; no figs, because they are thistles; that they are therefore cruel and greedy, wolves that devour; that they cannot bear good fruit but do evil deeds. For this reason the Savior concludes: “So then, because they are a bad tree, you will know them by their fruits.”

Do not be surprised that He calls them false prophets, thorns, thistles, wolves, and evil trees. In many ways a person may be compared to many different things, according to different kinds of actions.

But also understand this: just as an evil tree can become useful if someone splits it and grafts it, and then it can bear good fruit once it becomes good, so an evil person can become good if he leaves his wickedness, and then he can do good works. And again, a good tree can be ruined and bear bad fruit. In the same way, a good person can become corrupted and do evil deeds.

Yet while a person is truly good, he does not commit mortal sins; and while a person is truly evil, he does nothing truly good. Therefore Christ says in Matthew 12:34: “How can you speak good things when you are evil?” That is: you cannot truly speak what is good while you yourselves are evil.

Those false prophets, of course, still speak Christ’s name. They recite the hours, they say mass, groaning often: “Lord, our Lord!” Again, groaning toward the people: “The Lord be with you!” And again: “In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ!” And they imagine — and the people with them — that this is precious to God and that in this way they will enter the kingdom of heaven. So Christ shows that they are deceiving themselves and says: “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father in heaven — that one will enter the kingdom of heaven.”

Understand this: a person says “Lord” to Jesus first with the heart, when he believes that Christ is truly God. Second, he says “Lord” with the mouth, when he confesses this openly. But these two are not enough for salvation.

Everyone who wants to be saved must be a servant of the Holy Trinity. Therefore he must add a third “Lord”: by his deeds, finally and fully doing the will of the heavenly Father.

False prophets, however, though they say twice, “Lord, Lord,” never truly say the third “Lord,” because they do not fully do the Father’s will to the end. Therefore they will not enter the kingdom of heaven.

Here Origen says: “Listen, you sluggish ones! Listen, you useless ones! You who trust that you will be saved just because you are called Christians — and yet you do not do Christian works so that you may truly be Christians, and you do not live Christian ways! To you who are in the Christian assembly this word is spoken. To you who believe, this address is given: It will not help you, human being, that you say, ‘Lord, Lord,’ if you do not serve God with fear, if you do not gladly fulfill His commandments, if you do not do all His will, if you do not keep yourself from every uncleanness and from all unbelief, if you do not put away all wickedness. You cry out in vain; you lift up your voice in vain, saying, ‘Lord, Lord.’ By your disobedience you call your own accuser, when you call Him ‘Lord’ but do not fear Him as Lord and do not serve Him with reverence. For He makes it very clear when He says: ‘Not everyone who honors me with the title Lord, not everyone who only with the mouth and in name calls me Lord without works, will enter the kingdom of heaven. But the one who does works worthy of my name, and lives in a way fitting to my holiness, that one will enter the kingdom of heaven.’”

So far Origen.

Now we see that faith and the spoken confession of faith do not save a person without doing God’s will. Saint James says in James 2:26 that “faith without works is dead.”

And though wicked priests perform many acts, those acts without love do not help them toward salvation, even if they help other believers — not because of the priests’ merit, but because those believers receive from wicked priests what God has ordained: baptism, God’s word, and other holy things.

So many simple people are like Christ’s humble sheep, and they must beware of such priests as of false prophets, so that they are not slyly led off God’s path; and they must beware of them as of hungry wolves, so that they are not devoured in their goods; and they must beware of them as of thorns and thistles, so that they are not pierced by them.

And they themselves must be careful not to become the same kind of people — especially that they not be evil trees, which will be cut down and thrown into the fire.

Whoever truly wants to escape that fate must say “Lord!” three times to his Savior.

That means: first, believe in Christ from the heart; second, confess Christ and His truth with the mouth; and third, by your deeds, carry out His will even to death.

May the merciful God grant us this faith, this confession, and this obedience, through the merit of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is our Savior.
