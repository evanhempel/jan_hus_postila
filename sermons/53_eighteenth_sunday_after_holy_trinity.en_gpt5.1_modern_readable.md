# Eighteenth Sunday After Holy Trinity

From Matthew, chapter 22, verses 35–46:

At that time the legal experts came up to Jesus, and one of them, a teacher of the Law, asked Him a question to test Him: “Teacher, which commandment is the great one in God’s Law?” Jesus said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and first commandment. And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments the whole Law and the Prophets hang.” Then, after He had gathered the legal experts together, Jesus asked them a question: “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is He?” They said to Him, “David’s.” He said to them, “Then how is it that David, speaking in the Spirit, calls Him Lord, saying: ‘The Lord said to my Lord [God the Father to God the Son], “Sit at my right hand (that is, in the best and most pleasant place), until I put Your enemies under Your feet”’? So if David calls Him Lord, even though he himself is lowly, how is He his son?” And no one was able to answer Him a word, and from that day on no one dared to ask Him any more questions [until Maundy Thursday].

Our Savior, Christ, was being trapped for death by the scribes, the teachers of the Law, and the priests. They were divided among themselves in their beliefs: some believed there would be a resurrection from the dead – these were the Sadducees – yet both groups did not believe in Christ, the true God. Still, they united together against Jesus and laid before Him three puzzles or questions.

First: “Should we pay tax to Caesar or not?” He proved to them that they should.

Second: a question about the resurrection of the dead. He proved that there will indeed be a resurrection.

Third: this question about the greatness of the commandment in the Law – that is, which commandment in God’s Law is the greatest. Our reading today is about this third question, to which the gracious Savior, for our instruction, gave a very good answer.

In this passage I notice, first, the evil of the legal experts – that they tried to test their own God with cunning. Second, I see the goodness and wisdom of Christ: His goodness, in that although they questioned Him deceitfully and out of malice, He still answered them humbly; and His wisdom, in that He answered them so well that no one was able to reply to Him.

The reading says: “At that time” – that is, on the Monday after Palm Sunday – “the legal experts came up to Jesus,” as if they were the ones who cared most diligently about God’s Law and His commandments.

Know this: in Christ’s time there were three main groups among the Jews who separated themselves from the common people in their understanding of the Law: the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Essenes.

The Pharisees – the scribes and lawyers – had set up their own human rules above God’s Law, just as Christ Himself showed them, saying in Matthew 15:3: “Why do you break God’s commandment for the sake of your own traditions, teaching human commands and human doctrines?” These legal experts were very fierce enemies of Christ and very evil. That is why Christ called them an evil generation, adulterous, unbelieving, sons of the devil, and a brood of vipers. And following in their footsteps are the evil legal experts of today – those who value their own rules more than God’s commandments, like many great prelates.

The Sadducees held that there is no resurrection from the dead and that the soul dies at once with the body.

The third group were the Essenes. They lived apart, holding marriage in contempt and despising it; they held all things in common; they avoided proud clothing and rich varieties of food; they took pride in simple dress.

Our reading does not speak about the Essenes, but about the first two groups. For Matthew 22:34 says: “The Pharisees” – that is, the legal experts – “hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, gathered together,” and “one of them, a teacher of the Law, asked Him,” and so on, as our reading says.

So, as Matthew tells us, when Jesus had shut the mouths of the Sadducees about the resurrection of the dead, and they fell silent, the legal experts, hearing this, joined with the Sadducees in unity against Jesus. Heretics joined with other heretics against the truth. Why? *Svatý Jan Zlatoústý* (Saint John Chrysostom) says: they wanted to defeat Him by sheer numbers, since they could not defeat Him by understanding. Stripped naked by the truth, they showed this by trying to protect themselves with numbers and noise, and tried whether they could frighten Him and overcome Him by their clamor.

“They came up to Jesus” physically, but spiritually they moved far away from Him.

“And one of them, a teacher of the Law,” that is, a master or teacher, “asked Him.” The explanation says: one asked for all. If he could defeat Jesus, then they would all share in the victory; but if he was defeated, he alone would bear the shame.

“Testing Him” – that is, looking for something in His answer to trap Him. “Teacher, which commandment is great” – that is, the greatest – “in the Law,” in God’s Law?

Here it might seem that Mark’s Gospel does not agree with this reading. Our text says that this man questioned Jesus “to test Him,” but Mark 12:34 says that Jesus told this same teacher, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.”

The answer, as *Svatý Jan Zlatoústý* explains, is this: at first this teacher came with the others to Jesus with a bad intention, to test Him. But after he heard Christ’s true answer, he regretted his earlier intention and confirmed Christ’s answer, saying – as Mark 12:32–33 writes: “Teacher, you have truly said that God is one, and there is no other besides Him, and that He should be loved with all the heart,” and so on. And Christ said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.”

Whoever pays attention can see that this legal expert, learned in Scripture, although he did test the Lord Jesus at first, was still less evil than many teachers are now. You can see it in this: he asked a question that he had really weighed in his heart and understood. But today, many teachers, not knowing God’s commandments well, care more about human regulations than about the Law of God – like the *juristé*, the lawyers of the Church.

And because this master’s question was very useful, the dear Savior, our faithful Teacher and Master, answered him, saying: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and first commandment.”

With that answer Christ fully satisfied the question. He confessed the truth, He shamed His opponents, and He taught His faithful followers most profitably.

But why did Christ say that this commandment “You shall love” is the greatest and first? The legal expert did not ask, “Which is the greatest and first?” He only said, “Which is great?”

Here is the answer: the legal expert asked cleverly, hoping to catch Christ. If Christ had said, “This one is great,” and named, “You shall love,” then the legal expert could have replied, “Yes, but this one is also great: ‘You shall have no other gods.’”

So to cut off all such quibbling from the legal expert and his party, and to teach us, Christ said that this is the greatest and the first, or foremost, commandment: “You shall love the Lord your God,” and so on.

What does it mean to love God, and how must He be loved? I wrote about this in the 46th sermon, because this same commandment is set in the reading for the thirteenth Sunday after the Holy Trinity. But let me briefly remind you: God is the highest good, the best good. And as a person knows God, so he loves Him.

First, the saints in heaven know Him as He really is; therefore they love Him very greatly, just as this commandment says: “You shall love the Lord your God,” and so on.

Second, the wise *philosophi* know God by their reasoning and arguments.

Third, simple people know God by faith.

According to these three ways of knowing or seeing God, humans love Him in different ways.

A person is very poor and defeated in knowledge and in seeing God if he cannot lift up his mind enough to know that God, in His divinity, is not a created thing, and also that God is the highest good and rules over all created things. And because God is the highest, best good, therefore He must be loved – first of all for Himself, in Himself. From this comes the conclusion that we must love God first and above all, and love nothing else except as it is related to His will and His praise. We must not love anything except what He Himself loves.

From this we also learn that for no created thing that a person could possess – and for no created thing he might hope to keep, not even to escape death – may a person commit sin. The reasoning is this: God cannot will that a person should sin, because sinning is evil. And since God cannot will that a person sin, a person’s will must be drawn into agreement with God’s will, so that he also does not will sin.

More than that: from this we learn that every person must shape his will to be like God’s will in everything, so that he wills nothing except what God wants him to will. A person makes his will like God’s will when he does not choose anything except what God wants him to choose.

From this we gain yet another teaching: whenever a person wants to have something and he does not have it, then he should desire it in this way, saying in his heart: “If it is God’s will that I should have it.” The dear Christ taught us this when He prayed to the Father, saying in Matthew 26:42 and Mark 14:36: “Father, if You are willing, take this suffering away from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done.”

From that we learn again: everyone must fully submit himself to God’s will and not complain against God, whatever may come upon him. For a faithful soul is the bride of Christ, and a good wife should submit her will to her beloved husband in all worthy matters. And since the faithful soul belongs to Christ and knows of Him that He cannot allow anything to happen to her except what is fitting and useful to her – as long as she herself does not wander away – therefore she must patiently and gladly endure whatever comes to her.

Why then must a person love God? Gather it up like this.

First, because He is the supreme good – the highest, best good, above which no better can even be imagined.

Second, because He is the Creator of all things besides Himself.

Third, because He is the Redeemer of human beings who, because of sin, would have been condemned.

Fourth, because He holds all things in His power so that they do not fall into destruction.

Fifth, because He will glorify His faithful servants in both soul and body.

And for many other reasons besides these, which move a person, he must love the Lord his God. For the Savior says: “You shall love the Lord your God.”

“Lord” – the One who has power to punish.

“God” – the One who knows every evil.

“Your” – the One who has a rightful claim over you.

So He can, He knows how, and He wants to punish you when you sin. Because He is Lord, we must fear Him. Because He is a good Lord, we must love Him.

I say a *good* Lord, because He asks nothing from His servant except what is useful for the servant. He has servants not because He needs them, but because, out of the greatness of His lordship, He wants the servant – who is in need – to be lifted up by Him who needs nothing. And because He cannot command us anything unprofitable, He alone is the one Lord whom we can never serve by doing evil.

He is also a good Lord because He cannot fail to reward His servant. Rather, He always gives every servant more than he has deserved.

Third, God is a good Lord because He defends His servant against all enemies and stands in for all the losses of His servants.

How strange and foolish a person is, then, that he does not serve this Lord with all his strength, and does not love this Lord above all other masters – this Lord of whom Christ says: “You shall love the Lord your God.”

“Lord” – and so the Father is your Lord.

“God” – and so the Son is your God.

“Your” – and so the Holy Spirit is especially your own.

Your Lord is the Father; your God is the Son; especially yours is the Holy Spirit.

And how must a person love God? Christ says: “with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.”

“With all your heart” – that is, strongly, loving God the Father.

“With all your soul” – that is, wisely, loving God the Son.

“And with all your mind” – that is, willingly, loving the Holy Spirit.

Strongly – so that you are not led astray by pleasures, delights, and sweet indulgences.

Wisely – so that you are not deceived by cleverness and trickery.

Willingly – so that you are not broken by hardships and opposition.

This is what it means to love “with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind”: that for the love of God, a person overcomes pleasures, clever deceptions, and hardships, loving the Lord his God more than all other things. For the true God, Christ, says that this is “the greatest and first commandment.”

It is the greatest, because it draws a person to the greatest of all things. It is the first, because it must be fulfilled first of all; no other commandment can truly be fulfilled without it.

Then Christ says: “And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”

Pay attention to His words: He says, “the second is like it.” He does not say it is equal to it or just as great, but *like* the first – like it in this, that it also commands love, and that it draws us to a human being, who by his soul is like God.

So whoever loves his neighbor is loving God in His image and in a being that is like Him. And because a person is the image of the Holy Trinity in his soul and not so much in his body, therefore everyone must love the soul of his neighbor more than his neighbor’s body, and even more than his own body.

I say that a person is like the Holy Trinity in his soul because, just as God – the Holy Trinity – is Spirit, so the human soul is spirit. And just as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are three Persons and one God, so understanding, memory, and will are three “things” and yet one soul.

Therefore Christ, the best Master, says: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart” – that is, drawing your whole understanding toward Him; “with all your soul” – that is, drawing your whole will toward Him; “and with all your mind” – that is, turning your whole memory toward Him.

Now you see how understanding, will, and memory – these three – are in the soul and make a person to be the image of the Holy Trinity. And when a person loves God in this way – wisely, willingly, and with full remembrance, just as Christ commands – then he is an image that truly resembles God, who is the Holy Trinity.

But when he does not love in this way, then he is still God’s image, but not a likeness of the Trinity – as a picture might be a king’s image, but not yet a true likeness, until it is formed so that the face is like his. When at last it has a face like the king’s, even if not perfectly, then it is a real image, resembling the king.

Now you can understand why the Savior says that the second commandment is like the first: because it also commands love, as the first does, and because it directs us toward a person whose soul is like God.

He says: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” That is: whatever you would rightly want your neighbor to do for you in a similar situation, that you should, if you can, do for him.

If you want to know more on what it means to love your neighbor and who your neighbor is, look back to the 46th sermon. But I will add this: the Savior does not command you to love each person *more* than yourself, nor even *as much as yourself* in every way. There must be an order in love.

There are two kinds of love: ordered and disordered.

Love is *ordered* when a person loves God, himself, and his neighbor as God commands.

Love is *disordered* when a person loves God, himself, or his neighbor in a way God forbids.

Therefore, if someone loves the Lord God more because God gives him wealth, than because God is the highest good, then he has turned the order of love upside down and loves in a disordered and evil way – like a shameless woman who “loves” the man who pays her money for adultery.

In the same way, a person loves himself in a disordered way when he agrees with sin in himself.

He loves his neighbor in a disordered way when he loves him because of sin – for example, because of adultery – or when he helps him gain wealth by sin, or when he will not correct him even though he knows the other is sinning and he has the power to correct him. Or when he loves someone for wealth, fine clothes, physical attractiveness, or some other thing that is not a virtue – so that for these reasons he loves a person who is less useful to the holy Church more than another who is more useful to the Church – then he is going wrong in love of neighbor.

Therefore a person very much needs to order his love rightly: to love God above all, and then to love himself in a proper way. Ordered love for others must begin with rightly ordered love of oneself, and then extend to loving one’s neighbor’s soul more than one’s own body – so that, if needed, a person would even risk his own life for the salvation of his neighbor.

But sadly, in this commandment almost the whole world is wandering astray.

And regarding neighbors, know that there can be three kinds of love.

Some neighbors are related by nature – like father, mother, children, brothers.

Some are related by marriage and family ties – like a wife, son-in-law, brother-in-law, and others.

Some are neither related by blood nor by marriage, but are joined to us by virtue.

By natural bond, a father or mother loves a child more than a child loves father or mother.

Within family ties of marriage, husband and wife are closest to one another. Therefore a husband must love his wife more than father or mother with regard to the bond of marriage, but he must love his father and mother more than his wife with regard to their spiritual well-being. And above all he should love the one who is more virtuous and more useful to the holy Church.

A person must not love anyone simply for worldly advancement or for some kind of empty comfort – unless that advancement and comfort lead toward virtue and so toward benefit for the holy Church, toward God’s praise and the salvation of the person he loves.

From this you learn that you can love one neighbor more than another in one order of love, and less in another. For example, for the sake of virtue and usefulness to the holy Church, I should love a foreigner who is virtuous and helpful to the Church more than my own brother who is less useful. And yet, by natural bond, I should love my brother more, as long as I see that he is not living in open sin, than that same foreigner, however useful he is.

So love must be ordered in this way: whatever is more precious to God and more useful to the holy Church must come first in our love.

Now you can rightly understand how you are to love your neighbor “as yourself.”

The dear Master Jesus goes on to say that “on these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.”

“All the Law” – that is, God’s Law – “hangs,” that is, depends, is fulfilled, in these commandments, in its teachings and its judgments.

The commandments are fulfilled like this: the first great commandment of Christ contains in itself the first three commandments of the first tablet of Moses. For whoever loves God with all his heart has turned his whole heart toward God, and so he has no other gods. Whoever loves God with all his soul does not take the name of God in vain upon his soul. And whoever loves God with all his mind does not turn his mind to empty things, but remembers God’s goodness, drives empty vanities out of his soul, and remembers to keep the holy day.

So you see that in this first great commandment of Christ, those three commandments are enclosed and brought to fulfillment.

Then on the second commandment hang the seven commandments of the second tablet of Moses, to be fulfilled. For whoever loves his neighbor as himself honors his father and mother, if they are still alive – he obeys them in what is good, or he leads them to what is good, and if they are in need, he helps them and behaves humbly toward them. If they are dead, he prays for them in hope toward God. If one is living and the other dead, then his love is divided in this way: he prays to God for the one who has died and does good to the one who is alive – for that is what he would rightly wish to receive from his own children, if he had them.

Likewise, if he loves his neighbor, he will not kill him unjustly, for he would not want his neighbor to kill him when he is innocent.

Also, if he rightly loves his neighbor, he will not commit adultery with his neighbor’s wife; he will not steal from him; he will not bear false witness against him; he will not covet his neighbor’s house or his wife or anything else that is his.

Therefore Saint Paul says to the Romans (13:8–9): “Whoever loves his neighbor has fulfilled the Law. For ‘you shall not commit adultery, you shall not kill, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness, you shall not covet what belongs to your neighbor,’ and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this word: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”

So says Saint Paul, showing how the other commandments of the Law are enclosed in this one commandment.

The reading continues: “Then, after He had gathered” – that is, called together – “the legal experts, Jesus asked them, saying, ‘What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is He?’”

Here Christ wants to prove to them that He is true God – and so must be loved with all the heart. And He also wants to prove that He is true man – and so must be loved as our neighbor.

Because if He is Lord over David, that great king, then He is God. And if He is David’s son according to the flesh, then He is true man.

So He said to them, “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is He?” And since they could not deny that the Christ is David’s son according to the flesh, “they said to Him, ‘David’s!’” They said this assuming that Christ is merely a man and not God.

But Christ, proving to them that He is David’s son and also God, said to them: “How then does David, in the Spirit” – that is, in the Holy Spirit, by the breathing of the Holy Spirit – “call Him Lord, saying (Psalm 109:1): ‘The Lord’ – that is, God the Father, who is Lord of all the world – ‘said to my Lord’ – that is, to His Son, God the Son, who is Lord as God, though He is My Son as a man – ‘Sit at My right hand,’ that is, in the very best and most pleasant place.”

Understand here that God the Father does not have physical right hands. And understand also that this “sitting” belongs to Christ according to His humanity – as man He has a place and joy above the angels and above all people in glory.

“‘Until I put Your enemies’” – that is, the legal experts, the Jews, and all the reprobate kept for condemnation – “under Your feet,” that is, made subject to You and under Your feet.

“And since David,” that great prophet and king, whose writings you accept as Scripture – “since David calls Him ‘Lord’ by the Holy Spirit, even though He is a poor man, how is He his son?”

In other words: He is not merely David’s son if David calls Him “Lord.” He is the Son of God, not just the son of David.

“And no one was able to answer Him a word.” They did not dare deny David’s writings, and they could not find any other way out.

Christ did not rebuke them for saying that the Christ is David’s son. He only wanted to give them understanding that He is also David’s Lord: David’s son according to His humanity, and David’s Lord according to His divinity.

Because Christ defeated them with plain Scripture, the reading adds: “And from that day no one dared to question Him anymore,” for they now feared being shamed in the same way.

One of the explanations says: their disgrace is instruction for the good. The wicked are put to shame so that the good may be corrected; what God does to the wicked happens for the benefit of the righteous.

So in this reading we have the fullness of Christ’s Law. This Law teaches most clearly that we must love God. And this Law is the most natural, the easiest, the shortest, and the most useful Law, given by God, who is blessed forever. Amen.
