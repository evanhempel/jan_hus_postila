# First Sunday of Lent

Saint Matthew writes in chapter 4, verses 1–11:

“At that time, when Jesus had been baptized, he was led into the wilderness by the [Holy] Spirit so that he would be tempted by the devil. And when he had fasted for forty days and forty nights, eating and drinking nothing, afterward he was hungry. Then the tempter – the enticer, the deceiver – came to him and said, ‘If you are the Son of God – or rather, since you are the Son of God – tell these stones to become loaves of bread.’ But Jesus answered him, ‘It is written: A man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’ Then the devil took him – carried him or led him – into the holy city, Jerusalem, and set him on the highest point of the temple, on the roof where the preaching seat stood, and he said to him, ‘If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written about you – by David in Psalm 91: He gave orders to his angels concerning you, and they will carry you in their hands so that you will not even strike your foot against a stone.’ Jesus said to him, ‘It is also written: You shall not test the Lord your God.’ Again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory, and he said to him, ‘All these things – all these kingdoms – I will give you, if you will bow down and worship me.’ Then Jesus said to him, ‘Go away, Satan! For it is written: You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him alone.’ Then the devil left him, and look – angels came near and served him.”

This holy reading is not read today because Christ was tempted by the devil on this exact date, or because he was led into the wilderness exactly on this day. No. Immediately when John baptized him, at that very time the Holy Spirit led him into the wilderness. And after forty days the devil tempted him. It is read today so that Christians, hearing that their merciful Savior fasted for their sins, was tempted, and overcame, would also fast for their sins and resist the temptations of the devil. By the example of our Savior we are to fast and prepare ourselves to face temptation so that we may overcome it.

And who can endure both – fasting and temptation – unless the Holy Spirit helps him, the same Spirit who led Jesus into the wilderness? Understand it like this: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit together led Jesus, the man, into the wilderness, just as the reading says: “Jesus was led into the wilderness by the Spirit,” that is, the Holy Spirit, and not for nothing, but so that he would be tempted by the devil.

Every knight of Jesus must notice this and take it to heart: in his King Jesus he must see three things – the battle, the victory, and the reward. The battle: that he fasted and was tempted. The victory: that the tempter left him. The reward: that the angels came and served him. This is the same road his knights must walk, for this victorious One says (John 12:26): “If anyone serves me, let him follow me.” And the faithful knight must not lose heart, for the Lord will be with him, as he promised his knights (Matt. 28:20): “I am with you until the end of the world.”

Since Christ is with us, Saint Paul says (Romans 8:31), “If God is for us, who can be against us?” He himself gives strength, wisdom, and willingness so that we may follow him strongly, wisely, and willingly. Look at him: he received baptism from John in great humility, and for us sinners he was led by the Spirit into the wilderness. As Saint Gregory says: by the Spirit, without doubt the Holy Spirit.

And we can see several reasons why the Holy Spirit led him into the wilderness. First, so he could pray in secret for his faithful ones. Second, so that his defeat of the devil would be made visible. Third, so he would show us the true pattern of repentance: that we should grieve for our sins away from worldly distractions that pull us toward sin, and that we should patiently restrain ourselves from bodily pleasures, for a great part of repentance lies in this.

No faithful Christian should think otherwise: Christ’s being alone in the wilderness, his forty-day fast, is an example for every Christian, and a blessing for the whole holy Church. So also is his holy temptation by the devil, about which it is written: “Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.” Saint Gregory therefore says: It was truly just that he overcame our temptations by his own temptations, just as he came to overcome our death by his own death.

But we must understand that temptation happens in three ways: by suggestion, by delight, and by consent. When we are tempted, we often fall either into delight or into consent, for we are conceived in bodily sin and carry within us the very thing that gives temptation power over us. But God, who took flesh in the virgin’s womb, came into the world without sin. He had nothing in himself that was opposed to God. Therefore he could be tempted by suggestion, but the pleasure of sin could never touch his mind. All of the devil’s temptation was from the outside, not from within. So says Saint Gregory.

To understand him, know this: some temptation is internal. For example, when a person feels bodily stirring toward sexual sin, even though nothing outside is enticing him; or when a person thinks evil thoughts although no one is pushing him to do so. Christ could not have this kind of temptation, because it falls only on those who have been corrupted by Adam’s sin and conceived by bodily act. But since Christ was conceived in the virgin by the Holy Spirit, he was exempt from that kind of temptation.

External temptation comes from something outside the person who is tempted. In this way Christ was tempted outwardly by the devil. And that temptation was really the devil’s attempt to investigate a hidden mystery in Christ. The devil did not know whether Christ truly was the Son of God. Wanting to find this out, he tempted him concerning power: could he turn stones into bread? If Christ did it, the devil would learn the secret. But the devil thought it would be a crude, obvious temptation if he had no reason at all for it, so he waited until Christ was hungry and then tempted him.

Human temptation, which is completed fully in sin, happens – as Saint Gregory said – in those three stages: first suggestion, when an evil thought appears in the mind. If a person fights it and refuses consent, there is no sin, even though this came from his sinful condition. This is like the strong stirrings toward lust that Saint Paul himself felt, and that others feel. Then it goes further: the person begins to take pleasure in that inner movement but still does not consent to act. Already there is sin here, but not yet deadly sin. Finally comes consent to the sinful act.

Here is an example. Peter sees a beautiful woman. He feels bodily stirring, but he does not like that stirring; he suffers it with sorrow, fearing to sin against God. Then he has no sin. But if he looks at her, feels bodily stirring toward her, and takes delight in looking, then he already sins, even if he has not yet consented to act. And if he has the stirring and the delight and now also gives consent – he would do the deed if he had the chance – then he has committed a mortal sin. For he has broken God’s commandment (Exodus 20:17): “You shall not desire your neighbor’s wife” – that means: with consent.

By “another man’s wife” we must understand here: any woman who does not belong to him in marriage, whom he desires not as his wife but just for bodily lust. Understand the same when Christ says (Matt. 5:27–28): “You have heard that it was said to the people of old, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I say to you: whoever looks at a woman in order to desire her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” That means: if he desires her and consents inside, wanting to commit the act if it were possible. And know this: as many times in a day as he consents, so many mortal sins he commits.

Many people think they are not committing mortal sin when they gaze at one another with delight, kiss, or touch each other in other ways, because they say, “We are not planning to go all the way.” Saint Augustine speaks against this: because of the enjoyment of lust, even without the decision to complete the act, the whole person can be condemned. The “whole person” is the soul with the body. Therefore we must close our eyes, and guard ourselves from such touching.

Notice how sin runs its course: first the thought jumps into the mind, then it is toyed with in the mind, then comes enjoyment, and then consent against the command of God. This is what Saint James means in his letter (1:15): “Desire, when it conceives, gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is completed, gives birth to death” – that means eternal damnation. So evil desire with consent is mortal sin.

And this desire is threefold. First: evil desire with consent but without outward act. Second: when it is completed in act. Third: when this evil desire is held in constant inner enjoyment. After the act comes habit, after habit comes hardness of heart, after hardness comes despair, after despair comes final impenitence, and immediately after death in that state comes eternal damnation.

I have written more about temptation in my books on God’s commandments. I remind you of it here because today’s reading says: “Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil,” but not by his own desire – as other people are.

Christ was tempted by the devil in three ways: by greed for food, by pride, and by ambition for power and riches. And in all three he defeated the devil, just as the devil had used these three to defeat Adam.

By greed for food the devil tempted Eve when he showed her the fruit of the forbidden tree and advised her to eat. By pride he tempted her when he said (Genesis 3:5): “You will be like gods.” And by covetous desire he tempted when he said: “You will know good and evil.” Covetousness is not only about money; it is also about being lifted up, as Saint Gregory says when he comments that if the grasping robbery of praise did not cling to covetousness, Saint Paul would never have said of the one Son of God (Philippians 2:6): “He did not seek to seize equality with God as a robbery.” By this kind of covetous desire for exaltation the devil pulled our father Adam into pride.

So in the same ways by which he had thrown down the first man, by those same ways he was himself defeated by the second Man when he tempted him. He tempted Christ by greed when he said, “Tell these stones to become bread.” He tempted him by pride and empty boasting when he said, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down.” He tempted him by covetous desire for power when he said, “All these things I will give you if you bow down and worship me.”

Our new Adam, Christ, conquered the devil in temptations of greed, pride, and covetousness, and gave us an example to do the same. He fasted against greed, as the reading says: “When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward he was hungry.”

Our merciful Savior has made these forty days of fasting holy for us and has given us an example to fast forty days – not as he did, without eating or drinking at all, but still to fast. Even though he did not explicitly command us to fast forty days, his example and the Church’s worthy ordinance call us to it. For in the year of our Lord 138, Pope Telesphorus established this fast and also that three Masses should be celebrated on Christmas night. So we ought to fast following our Savior’s example and according to this worthy command, and for three reasons.

First, so that bodily lust will be restrained in us. Second, so that our minds will be lifted to heavenly things; we have the example of the holy Daniel, to whom the Lord revealed hidden things when he fasted for that very purpose. Third, so that we may make satisfaction for sins. Since the body has taken too much delight in drinking, eating, and in some people also in sexual sin, it is just that the body should also suffer.

God says (Joel 2:12): “Turn back to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with lamenting.” In the second chapter Joel is saying: “Turn back! You had turned away from me by greed and lust; now turn back by fasting, holding yourselves back from good things that you used to use in a bad way.”

Saint Gregory therefore says: Whoever is grieved that he has taken what was unworthy must also hold back from some things that are worthy; and whoever has done what was forbidden should take from himself something that was allowed.

Know also that not everyone is bound to this fast. Those excused are the sick, pregnant women, little children, and the poor who have nothing to eat – and these poor ones often fast more truly than the rich gluttons! Our fast must be a good fast. First, we must be without mortal sin, otherwise our fasting is useless, as God says (Jeremiah 14:12). When the fast is good, sins are restrained, virtues are increased, the mind is lifted up to God, and eternal reward is given.

During this season, at Mass, from now until the last Wednesday, on every weekday, these words are sung in the *praefatio* – that is, in the prayer the priest speaks to God before he says the words by which the bread becomes Christ’s body. The priest says: “God, you who by bodily fasting restrain sin, lift up the mind, grant virtue and reward, through our Lord Jesus Christ.” There you hear what good things the Lord God gives through a good fast. So let us fast with our dear Christ, and we will defeat the devil.

The reading continues: “The tempter came close and said to him: If you are the Son of God.” That is: “If – as I suppose – you are the Son of God, equal with God the Father, tell these stones to become bread.” The devil knew that God had said (Genesis 1:6): “Let there be heaven,” and there was heaven; and that whatever God says, “Let it be,” it is. No one else has such power. So, wanting to recognize God, he asks Christ to speak so that stones would become bread. He first tested Christ’s power through greed for food, thinking Christ, because of hunger, would be more ready to sin by greed than in other ways. And also because by this same sin of greed he had deceived the first Adam in paradise, he wanted to deceive the second Adam in the wilderness.

To push Christ into this, he says: “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.” Here he mixes pride into the temptation, but openly he attacks with greed. He makes this sin heavier by mentioning bread and not some other food, for uncontrolled use of ordinary food is often a worse sin than seeking delicacies. Also, by suggesting plain bread he hoped Christ would not suspect temptation.

But our merciful Savior, in his first defense, immediately brings in Scripture. As the reading says, “He answered and said, ‘It is written: A man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’” Since the word of God is food for the soul and better than bodily bread, why should I, leaving the word of God, grab at bodily bread? God’s word even feeds the body, when it restrains its desires and strengthens it so that it does not perish. We see this in Moses (Exodus 24:18; 34:28), whom God fed forty days on the mountain with his words, by which Moses was better fed than if he had eaten bodily food. So Christ smothered this temptation to greed with Scripture.

“Then the devil took him into the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple.” Did he lead him on foot, or did he carry him? I do not know. Saint Gregory thinks he carried him, saying: “He was led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness so that his own Spirit would lead him there where the evil spirit would find him for temptation. But when you hear that God made man was taken to a high mountain or to the holy city, reason and human ears tremble.” In such words Gregory suggests that Christ was carried. And he adds that this is not hard to believe, since we see other wonderful works in him.

Certainly the devil is the head of all evil people, and all evil people are his members. Was it not the devil’s members – the hostile Jews and the soldiers – who tortured Christ? So why should it be strange that he allowed the devil to carry him up on the mountain to tempt him, when he allowed the devil’s members to torture him to death? So says Gregory. Yet I cannot say for sure if he carried him or led him, and how exactly this was done. But why did the devil take him to the preaching seat on top of the temple, where God’s law was taught to the people?

Perhaps the devil turned there because Christ had just defeated him by the Scripture. As if he thought: “You, you! This one knows the Scripture. I usually catch such men on the preaching chair – where Scripture is taught – by pride. So I will move him there and test him there.” So the devil took him into the holy city Jerusalem, which was holy then because of holy Christ and his holy ones, and he set him there and tempted him with pride, wanting Christ proudly to show his power by throwing himself down. To support this, the devil brought a Scripture from Psalm 91:11–12: “It is written: God ordered his angels about you, that they will carry you in their hands so that you will not hurt your foot on a stone.”

From this we can also see it is no wonder if Christ allowed himself to be carried by an evil angel from the wilderness to the city in such a way that no one in the city saw it. But Christ again defends himself against this temptation with Scripture. He says (Deuteronomy 6:16): “It is written: You shall not test the Lord your God.”

Understand this: Christ does not mean that the devil must not tempt him, as if he were saying to the devil: “Do not test me, the Lord your God.” Rather, he quotes a command addressed to every human being: “You shall not test the Lord your God.” And since I am a man and could simply climb down, why should I throw myself down and test the Lord my God?

Everyone tests the Lord his God when he looks for some special proof of God’s power without any real need. A man would do this if he could easily climb down from a height without harm but instead jumped off saying, “God will keep me safe.”

The third time the devil tempted Jesus by covetous desire. The reading says: “Again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.” He showed them by speaking and by some way of laying them out before his mind – their kingdoms, their wealth, and all that belongs to them. Here he also mixes in pride and blasphemy, and says, lying in his promise: “All these things – these kingdoms – I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.”

One of the interpreters says here: “Look, this is the devil’s old pride! At the beginning he wanted to make himself equal with God, and now again. For to be worshiped and bowed to as the highest – that belongs only to God himself.” And because the devil could not find any Scripture to support his wicked demand, he fell silent.

Our Lord Jesus teaches us here how a person must patiently bear wrongs done to himself, but must not bear wrongs done directly against God. So at once he rebukes the devil, saying, “Go away, Satan!” Before this, the devil had hoped that Christ did not know who he was, and that Christ would argue with him like with a man only from Scripture. But by calling him “Satan,” he shows that he knows him and knows that his will is opposed to God. For *Satanas* is interpreted “adversary.”

Since God can reveal the devil’s lack and weakness, the devil could no longer bring in Scripture. So Christ brings in Scripture again (Deuteronomy 6:13): “It is written: You shall worship the Lord your God.” The devil’s argument was very foolish – that by showing him the kingdoms he might persuade Christ to worship him as God, promising falsely to give them. So the devil, defeated by Christ in this battle and shamed and judged by God, went down to hell. The reading says: “Then the devil left him, and angels” – who had withdrawn from Christ for a time so that the devil would be deceived and Christ’s victory more glorious – “came near to him and served him,” as their highest Lord.

Saint Gregory says about this: We must notice that when the reading says, “The devil left him, and the angels came and served him,” in one and the same person we see both things: that he is a man, since the devil tempts him; and that he is God, since the angels serve him. So in him we must recognize our own nature, for if the devil had not known him to be man, he would not have tempted him; and we must honor in him his divinity, for if he were not God above all, the angels would not serve him. So far Gregory.

All the works of our Savior are for our teaching, just as everything written in Scripture is written for our teaching. Therefore we must pay attention to Christ’s three temptations and his victories, so that we too may defeat the devil. No member of Christ, and no member of the devil either, is tempted at the beginning or at the end of life except by some temptation that belongs under one of these three – greed, pride, or covetous desire. And we cannot defeat the devil except in the same way, even if not as perfectly as Christ did.

Notice that our Savior defended himself with Scripture. He did not say, “I am your Lord, I am your God,” though it was true. Today, however, the disciples of antichrist do not want faithful Christians to defend themselves with Scripture. They do not want to reveal Scripture to the common people. They want them to obey whatever they command without question. And when faithful believers ask them to show everything from Scripture, they say, “There! He is one of them! A Wycliffite! He does not obey holy Church!” By this they mean: he does not do whatever they wish.

But our dear Christ held firmly to his Scripture and, teaching us, defeated all the devil’s temptations by Scripture. Let us do the same. When bodily sin tempts us – to fornication or gluttony – let us defend ourselves with Scripture, saying: “Spiritual joy is greater than bodily pleasure; by it a person truly lives better than by bodily pleasure.” And again: “This bodily pleasure is very short, but spiritual joy is eternal.” And again: “The sexually immoral and adulterers will not inherit the kingdom of heaven.” And again: “The rich man who dressed in fine clothes and feasted splendidly every day died and was buried in hell.”

Against the second temptation, that of pride, when the devil pushes us to seek high positions, let us remember that he himself was thrown out of heaven into eternal fire because he reached for a high place in a disordered way. Let us hold to the safe side, knowing that the more someone humbles himself here, the more God will exalt him, and seeing how those who are exalted here will be cast down forever.

Against the third temptation, covetousness, let us recall the Scripture (Ephesians 5:5): “The covetous person will not inherit the kingdom of heaven,” and that covetousness is idolatry. But, to our shame, there are few today who, with Christ, overcome these three sins. Especially among priests many are defeated by these temptations of the devil. Out of covetousness they in fact bow down and worship the devil so that they may have enough property and income. They do not say to antichrist, who commands people to kneel before him and promises to give them dignities and benefices, “Go away, Satan – adversary!” No. Instead they bow to him more deeply, with more fear and more honor than they give to God.

The likeness between the devil and antichrist is very close. Just as the devil said to Christ, “I will give you all these kingdoms,” though he did not know them all and had no power over them, so antichrist promises and hands out dignities and benefices to those who bow to him. But in this he even surpasses the devil: the devil at least pretended to give what he did not have; antichrist wants first to take for himself, before the one he “gives” to may enjoy anything. The devil wanted Christ to worship him secretly; antichrist wants people to worship him as openly as possible.

But the faithful must defend themselves with Scripture, saying, “It is written: ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him alone’” – that is, with the highest worship and the highest service, which belong only to him.

There is one more thing very striking to me: the Lord Jesus calmly listened when the devil quoted Scripture to him. But today’s prelates cannot bear it when – not the devil, but a faithful Christian – speaks Scripture with them and answers them from Scripture. They would like it if no lay person at all knew Scripture. I heard from a faithful man of good memory, Nicholas called Faulfish, who had been in England, that he knew a cook there, with whom he had once eaten together. The bishop asked this cook why he was reading the Bible in English against the bishop’s command. The cook defended himself with Scripture. Then the bishop said to him, “Do you know whom you are talking to?” The cook answered, “To a bishop, a man.” The bishop said, “And you, poor layman, dare to speak Scripture with me?” The cook replied, “I know well that you are not greater than Christ, and I trust that I am not worse than the devil. Since our dear Christ quietly listened to Scripture from the devil, why shouldn’t you, who are less than Christ, listen to Scripture from me, a man?” The bishop grew angry and would not speak with him further. So the cook defeated the bishop with Scripture, just as Christ defeated the devil.

Let us ask our dear Christ to give us help so that we may overcome the devil’s temptations and rejoice with the Lord Jesus after the victory. Amen.
