Jan Hus's sermon on Luke 7:11-16 recounts Jesus raising the widow's son at Nain, using this miracle to teach about spiritual resurrection from sin.  

### Key Points:  
- **Jesus' compassion**: He is moved by the widow's grief and raises her son, demonstrating divine power and mercy.  
- **Spiritual meaning**:  
  1. The dead youth symbolizes souls dead in mortal sin.  
  2. The widow represents the Church mourning sinners.  
  3. The bier signifies a conscience hardened by sin.  
  4. The bearers are sinful desires leading to damnation.  
- **Three resurrections**:  
  1. The girl (Jairus' daughter) = consent to sin without action.  
  2. The young man (Nain) = sin committed but not habitual.  
  3. Lazarus = habitual, "stinking" sin.  
- **Warning**: Those entrenched in sin (like Sodom) resist reproof, but Christ's call can still raise them.  
- **Exhortation**: Repent before sin becomes incurable through despair.  

> **Key Quote**:  
> "Blest are those who mourn" (Matthew 5:4) — not for bodily loss, but for souls from whom God has departed.
