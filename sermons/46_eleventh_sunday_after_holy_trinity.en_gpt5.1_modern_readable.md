# Eleventh Sunday After Holy Trinity

From Luke 18:9–14: At that time Jesus spoke this parable to some who were confident in themselves that they were righteous and looked down on others: “Two men went up into the temple to pray. One was a teacher of the law, and the other an open sinner. The teacher of the law stood and prayed these things with himself, boasting: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, unjust people, adulterers—or even like this open sinner here. I fast twice a week. I give tithes of everything I possess.’ But the open sinner stood at a distance. He did not want to lift his eyes up to heaven, but kept beating his breast and saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ I tell you the truth: this man—the open sinner—went down to his house justified rather than the other, for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”

Our merciful Savior, who is Himself humble, wanted to lead the proud into humility. So He set before us the example of two men: one proud, the other humble. He did this so that, as if looking into a mirror, we would turn away from pride, cling to humility, avoid insulting others, and instead confess our sins to the Lord God and ask for His mercy. For this reason, “Jesus spoke this parable to some who were confident in themselves that they were righteous and despised others: ‘Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a teacher of the law and the other an open sinner.’” Notice here three things about the teacher of the law. First, he abandoned the real reason he went into the temple; he went in “to pray,” yet he did not truly pray. Second, he was proud. Third, he despised his neighbor. So he gained nothing useful for himself; he remained in his sins and even added more. But the open sinner did four good things: first, he quietly and humbly admitted he was guilty in his sins; second, he was ashamed of them; third, he grieved over his sin; fourth, he prayed briefly and well over his sins. Therefore he received forgiveness of sins and went home justified. The teacher of the law exalted himself and was humbled; the open sinner humbled himself and was exalted. And it will be this way for everyone, depending on whether they follow the example of the teacher of the law or of the open sinner.

When our Savior gives us these two men as examples of how to pray, He says: “Two men went up into the temple to pray.” “Two,” so that love toward one’s neighbor would be preserved, for without love for our neighbor, prayer is not precious before God. “Men,” to show gentleness, for, as Aristotle says, a human being is by nature a gentle and social creature, made to live with others. Therefore the gentle Christ says (Matthew 11:29): “Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart.” “Went up,” the Latin says *ascenderunt*, “they went upward.” This shows that, in prayer, the mind must be lifted up to God, for true prayer is the lifting of the mind to God. And this the open sinner had. “Into the temple,” because the temple or church is a place especially suited for prayer, as I have written elsewhere in my books *On Prayer*. “To pray,” not to flirt, not to listen to empty tales, not to whisper uselessly or laugh, not to chase after greed and profit—things that many teachers of the law and many priests now seek in the church. Many of them would scarcely even glance inside the church if they were not getting some bodily benefit there. Such people ought to be driven out of the church, so they do not turn the house of God, the house of prayer, into a den of thieves. For in the house of God, as Saint Augustine says, no one should do anything except what the house of God was established for. And since it was established for the praise of God, then in it we should praise God by praying, by thinking about God, by preaching His word or hearing it, by singing, or by other holy works. Therefore, woe to those who in the house of God seek fornication, or greed, or stir up disorder, or commit other sins.

“These two men went up into the temple to pray: one a teacher of the law, and the other an open sinner.” By “teacher of the law” we may understand someone who separates himself from the common people by special customs and clothing, wanting to be seen as more holy than the ordinary people. And an “open sinner” is one who sins openly: commits sexual immorality, gets drunk, curses and swears badly, plays dice or other games for money, dances on feast days and also on other days, buys church offices, hoards many benefices greedily, dresses himself proudly from alms and wastes them, while people clearly see it. Also the one who openly runs after profit, as Saint Bede says that the *publicanus* was one who collected or rented the tolls, or sought the profit of this world by trading. So speaks that holy teacher. But according to the very words, both Latin and Czech—*publicanus*, *zjevný hřiešník*—an open sinner is the one who sins openly, without shame before people.

“And the teacher of the law stood and prayed these things with himself.” Know this: a person can pray well while standing, as the open sinner also stood and prayed; yet for prayer, the bodily posture that is generally most fitting, when time and place allow, is to kneel or to fall on one’s face. This is how the prophets and other saints prayed, and especially our merciful Savior. Saint Luke says (Luke 22:41) that, “having knelt down, he prayed.” And Saint Matthew says (Matthew 26:39) that “he fell on his face and prayed, saying, ‘My Father, if it is possible, let this suffering pass from me.’” Here you have the example of your Savior, that kneeling and falling on one’s face are worthy postures in prayer. Yet a person can pray acceptably standing, sitting, lying down, walking, even riding; but most devoutly on his knees or on his face. And to that bodily posture four other things must be joined: first, a pure heart; second, the lifting up of the mind; third, speaking true words; fourth, understanding what one says. Therefore I would rather say one “Our Father” with understanding and receive a reward, than many other prayers whose words I do not understand. And it is better to grieve for sins from the heart without words than to recite or sing a beautiful, invented speech. So Saint Gregory says: To pray rightly is the weeping of love’s sorrow from the heart, and not the mere producing of fine words.

Because the teacher of the law did not have that sorrow over sin, he did not pray rightly; therefore he remained in his sins. He did not ask anything of God, he exalted himself, he insulted others, he despised his neighbor who was praying beside him, and he went home still in his sin. He should first have accused himself, as Scripture says (Proverbs 18:17 in the old numbering): “The righteous person is the first to accuse himself.” That is, he first confesses his sin against himself, then he prays concerning them, and finally he gives thanks to God. But the teacher of the law did not do this; instead he began at the end, with thanksgiving, saying: “God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, unjust people, adulterers.” He condemns three kinds of sin and says he does not have them. First, robbery, meaning taking another’s property wrongly. Second, injustice, by which someone wrongs his neighbor in any way. Third, adultery. From this each of us should take instruction from the teacher of the law to recognize that these sins are great and to despise the sins themselves—but not despise people, not exalting ourselves over them as this teacher of the law did when he boasted: “I am not like other people.” Saint Augustine explains his meaning: “I alone am righteous, and all others are sinners.” And understand: when he says, “I am not like robbers,” he touches those who harm their neighbor in his property. When he says, “or unjust people,” he touches those who wrong their neighbor in his person. And when he says, “or adulterers,” he touches those who harm their neighbors by corrupting their wives.

Then he adds: “or even like this open sinner.” Here the commentators say: Because he had the open sinner right beside him, that became an even greater occasion for his swelling pride. For pride, whether it has good companions or bad, always causes harm. If it has a poor man beside it, it puffs itself up even more; if it has a successful man beside it, then it torments itself with envy. But humility gains everywhere. If it has a poor person beside it, it is then moved to pity. If it has a successful person beside it, it humbles itself even more. And know that there are four sides, or forms, of pride, as Saint Gregory says. The first side of pride is when someone who has something good thinks he has it from himself. The second is when, although he believes it was given to him, he imagines it was given because of his own merits. The third kind of pride is when someone boasts of some quality he does not actually have. The fourth kind of pride is when, despising others, he desires especially to be seen and regarded as above others because of what he has.

This teacher of the law was caught in that pride. He boasted that he was better and more righteous than other people. He goes on: “I fast twice a week; I give tithes of everything I possess.” Here he begins to list his good works. But they were not truly virtuous, because he did not do them in the right way—he did them while puffing himself up over others. For whoever does anything while knowingly keeping mortal sin in himself—thus not living in love—such a person does nothing truly good in God’s sight, even if the work looks good outwardly. Therefore his fasting was not a virtue, nor was his paying of tithes. So everyone must be careful that everything he does, he does free from mortal sin, and thus in love. For Saint Paul says (1 Corinthians 16:14): “Let all that you do be done in love!” There are two “sides” to righteousness. One is not to sin; the other is to do good. As David says to everyone (Psalm 34:14): “Turn away from evil and do good!” The teacher of the law thought he had both sides. He thought, first, that he did not sin, when he said, “I am not like other people.” And second, that he did good, when he said, “I fast twice a week.” But pride burned up his fasting and all his other works, just as today pride spoils the works of many others—especially of the teachers of the law, who exalt themselves over others with their works and their religious regulations. Their chanting of hours does not help them either, for Christ says (Matthew 15:8–9): “This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. In vain do they worship me, teaching human teachings and commandments.”

Then Christ continues: “But the open sinner stood at a distance. He did not want to lift his eyes up to heaven, but kept beating his breast and saying: ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’” Here our dear Savior praises the open sinner in four ways. First, He praises his fear and reverence, saying that he “stood at a distance,” as if afraid to come near. Second, He praises his shame, saying he “did not want to lift his eyes up to heaven,” as one who was ashamed before the God against whom he had sinned. Third, He praises his grief over sin, for “he kept beating his breast.” Fourth, He praises his confession and his short prayer, that he said, “God, be merciful to me, a sinner!” And without doubt, any sinner who, with such a heart, would confess himself and pray to God in this way, our merciful God would forgive his sins. To confirm this, Christ says: “I tell you the truth: this man,” that is, the sinner, “went down to his house justified rather than the other,” that is, the teacher of the law.

Saint Augustine comments on this and says: You have heard the story of the teacher of the law and of the open sinner—two opposite speeches; now listen to the judgment. You have heard the proud boaster; you have heard the guilty, humble sinner; now listen to the Judge: “I tell you the truth.” Truth speaks, God speaks, the Judge speaks: “I tell you the truth: that man went down from the temple to his house more justified—the open sinner—than the teacher of the law.” Tell us, Lord, the reason! Behold, you see that the open sinner went down from the temple more justified than the teacher of the law. Why? Listen to the reason: “For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.” You have heard the judgment; beware the evil cause! Again I say: Hear the judgment; beware of pride! Let those who presumptuously trust in their own virtue see and hear this! This is Saint Augustine’s teaching.

So in this reading we hear of two ladders. One is pride, by which people climb from the top downwards. The other is humility, by which people climb from the bottom up. On the first ladder stood the teacher of the law; on the second, the open sinner. The teacher of the law was cast down; the open sinner was lifted up. Therefore the Savior says that “everyone who exalts himself,” like that teacher of the law, “will be humbled. And whoever humbles himself,” that is, who walks in humility as this open sinner did, “will be exalted.” And it is without doubt that whoever exalts himself in this world and in his heart is smaller before God; and whoever humbles himself in his heart and in this world, that person God exalts before Himself. God will prove this when, on the last day, He lifts up the humble and casts down the proud, as the virgin Mary prophesied, saying (Luke 1:52): “He has brought down the mighty from their thrones and has lifted up the humble.” That is: He has already done this in many cases, and He will do it fully and finally on the Day of Judgment.

May our gracious Savior grant that we do not boast, that we do not despise our neighbors, but that we truly repent of our sins and pray humbly, so that we may enter our true home—the kingdom of heaven—justified, through the merit of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
