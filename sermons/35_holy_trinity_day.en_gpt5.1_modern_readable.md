# Holy Trinity Day

From Saint John, chapter 3, verses 1–15:

At that time there was a man from among the teachers of the Law, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. He came to Jesus—humbly, wanting to be taught the faith—by night, because he was afraid of the Jews, and he said to Him: “Master, we know that you have come from God as a teacher, for no one can do the miracles that you are doing unless God is with him in power and grace.”

Jesus answered him: “Truly, truly, I tell you: unless someone is born a second time—born spiritually—he cannot see the kingdom of God, the joy that never ends.”

Nicodemus said to Him: “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he go back into his mother’s womb and be born again?”

Jesus answered: “Truly, truly, I tell you: unless someone is born of water and of the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. What is born from the flesh by fleshly birth is flesh—a fleshly person; and what is born of the Spirit by spiritual birth is spirit—a spiritual person. Do not be astonished that I said to you: ‘You must be born again.’ The Spirit breathes where He wills—into whichever person He chooses by His grace—and you hear His voice in the Scriptures, but you do not know by what merit He has come, nor where He leads in the end. In this way it is with everyone who is born of the Holy Spirit, unknown even to himself.”

Nicodemus answered and said to Him: “How can these things be?”

Jesus answered and said to him: “You are a teacher in Israel—in the Jewish people—and you do not understand these things! Truly, truly, I tell you: we—that is, I and my apostles—speak what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, and you do not receive our testimony, you Jews. Since I have told you earthly things—easy things—about spiritual birth, and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things, such as My eternal begetting from God the Father?

No one goes up into heaven by his own power except the One who came down from heaven—that is, the One who took flesh while yet being in heaven—the Son of Man, who is in heaven. And just as Moses lifted up the bronze serpent in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in Him with a living faith unto death will not perish, but will have eternal life.”

**A.**

Today the holy Church celebrates the day of the Holy Trinity. And because Nicodemus, through this holy Gospel reading, was cleansed from unbelief and brought into faith in the Holy Trinity, this passage is read today at the Mass.

Some, instead, read the passage: “When the Comforter comes,” which was read on the Sunday after the Ascension. That passage also fits well today, because it mentions the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—three Persons who are the Holy Trinity, whom we are to praise in a special way today.

And because both the learned and the simple often go astray in their faith concerning the Holy Trinity, I will speak briefly and simply for the sake of simple people.

So understand this, simple listener: the Holy Trinity in whom we believe is not a woman, nor a virgin, nor “Sunday,” as fools think, but three eternal Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—one God, who is the highest Good, beyond whom nothing better can be imagined.

So, if a simple person asks you, “What is the Holy Trinity in whom you believe?” answer: “God the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.”

If he asks, “Who is the Father?” answer: “The eternal God, who has an eternal Son.”

If he asks, “Who is the Son?” answer: “God, begotten of God the Father.”

If he asks, “Who is the Holy Spirit?” answer: “God, who proceeds from God the Father and from God the Son.”

And say and believe that these three Persons are not three gods, but one true God; and also that these three Persons are equally powerful, equally wise, and equally good, so that each Person is God with immeasurable power, immeasurable wisdom, and immeasurable goodness.

Yet, for the sake of simple people, Scripture especially calls the Father “mighty,” so that they will not imagine that because He is “old,” He is less powerful than the Son; it calls the Son “wise,” so that they will not imagine that He is less wise than the Father; and it calls the Holy Spirit “loving” or “kind,” so that they will not imagine He is less good than the Father and the Son.

And because man in his soul is like the Holy Trinity, by whom he was created, let me show you this likeness. Just as the Holy Trinity is God, who is Spirit, so a human being, by his soul, is spirit. And just as the Father is a different Person than the Son and the Spirit, and the Son is different than the Spirit, so that the Father is not the Son nor the Holy Spirit, and the Son is not the Holy Spirit—yet the three Persons are one God—so also in the human soul.

One power of the soul is understanding; another is memory; another is will. Understanding is different from memory and from will, and memory is different from will, so that understanding is not memory nor will, and memory is not will; yet these three powers in a man are one soul.

Therefore a person, believing in the Holy Trinity who created him and to whom his soul is like, having power from God the Father, ought earnestly to resist sin and strongly to grow in virtue; second, having wisdom from the Son of God, he ought diligently to use that wisdom for God’s praise; and third, having good will from the Holy Spirit, he ought always to hold his will in what is good and to remain in that good will to the end.

When a person stands in this way, it is impossible for him to perish, because he keeps the image and likeness of the Holy Trinity. But when he, as if powerless, foolish, and unsteady, falls into mortal sin, then he destroys the likeness of the Holy Trinity, dishonoring the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit—and so the whole Holy Trinity.

**B.**

Know that by mortal sin a person loses the likeness to the Holy Trinity, but not the image, which he only smears and darkens by sin.

It is like this: suppose someone paints an image of a man that truly resembles him. If that picture is badly smeared, the image still remains, but it no longer has a clear likeness to that man. So it is, in some way, after sin. A person still has wisdom, understanding, memory, and will; yet he smears all of this with mortal sin, so that he is no longer so much like the Holy Trinity as he would be if he had no mortal sin upon his soul.

And when a person has thus smeared and corrupted himself, there is no way for him to return to that likeness except by the power, wisdom, and will of the Holy Trinity—and then by another “trinity” created within him: faith, hope, and love. And a person also cannot have this second trinity except from God.

Faith is faith in every truth of God, which the bodily eye does not see, but which Scripture commands the soul to believe. Hope is hope to receive grace and glory. Love is love from the whole heart, by which a person loves God completely.

Now, when a simple person believes rightly in the Holy Trinity and in everything else that ought to be believed, even if he cannot explain or discuss it in careful words, he has enough, provided he keeps God’s commandments.

That is how Nicodemus was taught in the faith. About him the Gospel says: “There was a man from among the teachers of the Law, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews”—that is, a master above the other Jews. “He came to Jesus,” meaning that he came humbly, wanting to learn more of the faith from Him, for he already believed something. He came “by night.” That shows that he was still in ignorance and fear; he did not yet truly know Christ, and he was afraid to come to Him publicly because of the Jews. For the Jews had already cast Jesus out, putting Him outside their fellowship, so that anyone who confessed He was the Christ would be cast out as well.

And although Nicodemus was the highest among the Jews in learning, he still did not want to stir up their anger against himself, since he could learn from Christ without causing a public conflict. So he came to Jesus by night.

And he humbly confessed Christ’s humanity when he said, “Master, we know that you have come from God as a teacher,” but he did not yet know Christ’s divinity. Still, he deserved that Jesus would now teach him also about faith in His divinity.

He offers a reason why Jesus is a teacher sent from God and a good man. He says: “No one can do the miracles you are doing unless God is with him.” With these words he shows that Jesus is truly a man, yet a man exalted above others as a teacher by a mission from God, and so a prophet above all others.

Therefore our dear Master Jesus, teaching him about the second birth of a human being, by which he is spiritually born of God to be a son of God, answered and said to him: “Truly, truly, I tell you: unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”

**C.** It is as if He said: “You know about bodily birth and about the beginning of faith in My humanity that comes from seeing My miracles. But beyond this you must be born a second time, spiritually, and become in a special way a chosen son of God. And since this birth can only be from God, Nicodemus, you have here proof that I am God, when by My power I make you a spiritual son of God.”

And Christ truly had this power. Saint John says in chapter 1, verse 12: “He gave them power to become children of God—those who believe in His name.”

Every intelligent person, even a pagan whose reason has been enlightened, can understand this: whoever can give to a man the power to become a child of God must himself be God. For a person can be a child of God only because God created him, sustains him, feeds him, and beyond that chooses him for eternal inheritance. Therefore no one but God can give a man the power to be a chosen child of God. For God alone, from eternity, chooses for salvation those whom He pleases.

And since a man who is not God does not have even for himself the power to be a chosen child of God, except by God’s grace and not by his own merit—as Saint Paul says to Titus (3:5), that God saved us “not because of works of righteousness, but according to His mercy”—how could a mere man give to another man the power to become a chosen child of God? If a man could do this without being God, then he could give to someone else the greatest grace, just as God does.

But you may say, “Yet Saint Paul writes to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 4:15), ‘In Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the word of God.’ And to the Galatians (4:19) he says, ‘My little children, for whom I am again in labor.’ There Paul talks about spiritual birth in the grace of God.”

So understand: when someone, by the word of God or by holy baptism, makes another into a child of God, it does not mean that he himself gives that person the power to become a child of God or that he chooses him to be a child of God. No, God first gave that person the power to become His child and first chose him to be His chosen child.

Take an example. Suppose an axe could speak—the axe by which a carpenter built a house. It would not boast, “I built this house,” but in truth it would say, “By my power the carpenter built this house.” In the same way Saint Paul, being like a tool or instrument of God, says (1 Corinthians 15:10): “By the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I have labored more than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God with me.”

And elsewhere (2 Corinthians 3:5) he says: “We are not sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God.”

And again (1 Corinthians 3:4–7): “When one says, ‘I follow Paul,’ and another, ‘I follow Apollos,’ are you not simply human? What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each. I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. So neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the growth.”

Paul means this: he, by preaching the word of God, planted faith in the Corinthians; Apollos, their bishop, baptized them; but God gave grace and so made them His children. Paul humbles his work and Apollos’s work in comparison with God’s work when he says, “Neither the one who plants”—he means himself—“nor the one who waters”—that is, baptizes, like Apollos—“is anything, but only God, who gives the growth.”

So we also must confess: when we preach, or baptize, or hear confessions, and through these acts men are brought into the grace of God, we must attribute all of it to God’s power, and not to our own, and never say that we can give anyone the power to be a child of God, or that we can choose someone to be God’s child.

**D.** Then the Gospel continues: Nicodemus, still crude and fleshly, not understanding Christ’s words about spiritual birth, says to Him: “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter his mother’s womb again and be born?”

It is as if he said: “I am an old man, and I ask You about my salvation. How then can I be born again according to Your words, so that I may be saved? Do I have to enter into my mother’s womb and be born a second time?”

Saint Augustine comments: “The Spirit speaks, and he understands in a fleshly way. Nicodemus knew of only one birth—from Adam and Eve. He did not yet know birth from God and from the holy Church.”

Yet understand spiritual birth by comparing it to how Nicodemus understood bodily birth. Just as a man cannot be born a second time physically, so he cannot be baptized a second time. That is Augustine’s point.

And we should not reject Nicodemus’s question as useless. His words—“How can a man be born when he is old? Can he go again into his mother’s womb?”—help us to understand bodily birth clearly and to see the difference between it and spiritual birth. His crude question helped him to be taught, and it can also help other crude people. Because of it, the best of all teachers, Jesus, immediately sets out spiritual birth and separates it from bodily birth. He says to Nicodemus: “Truly, truly, I tell you: unless someone is born of water and of the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.”

It is as if He said: “I am not speaking of birth from a bodily womb and from a man’s seed, but of spiritual birth, by which someone is born through water that will flow from My side, and by the grace of the Holy Spirit.”

From this you learn that everyone who is to be saved must be cleansed by water and blood that flowed from Christ’s side, and by the Holy Spirit.

**E.**

Know that there are three kinds of baptism: of water, of blood, and of the Spirit.

Baptism of water is when someone is baptized in water, as people are commonly baptized.

Baptism of blood is when someone who has not been baptized with water is cleansed from sins by shedding his blood for Christ.

Baptism of the Spirit is when someone, truly believing in God and in Jesus Christ, longs to be baptized, and the Holy Spirit cleanses him from his sins.

By this baptism of the Spirit—and of the water that flowed from Christ’s side—everyone who is to be saved must be baptized; yet without baptism by water, as it is commonly administered, a man may be saved. Many have been saved in both the Old and New Testaments by baptism of blood. For Christ they were slain and saved—like the holy infants killed by Herod, and many others who, believing the apostles or other saints, at once went willingly to death without water baptism.

Therefore when the Savior says, “Unless someone is born of water and of the Holy Spirit,” He means the water that flowed from His side and the Holy Spirit, who by His great power cleanses the soul from sin.

Then notice how kindly the Master teaches the difference between bodily birth and spiritual birth when He says: “What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.” With these words He shows that every human being is two things: spirit and body.

From this you should understand that as soon as a person truly lives, he already has a double birth. One side is from the body, which existed before it had a soul. The other side is from the spirit, which God quickly gives to the body. So, while still in the womb, every man is already born as to body and as to spirit, even though he has not yet been born out from his mother’s womb into the world.

Thus the angel said to Joseph concerning the conception of Jesus in the womb (Matthew 1:20): “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for what has been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit”—that is, the child conceived in her has been conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit.

Then there is the second birth of a person, the spiritual one, by which he becomes in a special, supernatural way a son of God by God’s power. It is about this birth that our dear Master is now speaking, and He wants to lead the crude Nicodemus into understanding it. He says: “Do not be amazed that I told you, ‘You must be born again.’ The Spirit blows where He wills, and you hear His sound, but you do not know where He comes from or where He goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”

According to the explanation of Saint John Chrysostom, Christ here gives a bodily example to Nicodemus. Though the wind blows, we do not know where it begins or where it ends, and it blows where it wills. So it is with a person who is spiritually born in baptism. You feel the water of baptism, the washing of the body; but the Holy Spirit who begins to wash, and the grace of God, and the final blessedness—these are hidden.

So according to this explanation, understand the words this way: “The spirit”—that is, the wind—“blows where it wills”—that is, where it is inclined to go—“and you hear its sound”—that is, the noise or whistling—“with your bodily ear; but you do not know”—that is, not with certainty—“where it comes from,” because you do not know where it begins and what causes it, “or where it goes,” where it ends. “So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit,” unknown even to himself, because he does not know whether he is from eternity among the elect and whether he will finally be saved.

Even though the one born as a son of God has the sign and breathing of the Holy Spirit, still, without a special revelation, he does not know how the Spirit began His work in him, nor how He will finish it.

According to the explanation of Saint Augustine, the words can be taken this way: “The Spirit”—that is, the Holy Spirit—“blows where He wills,” that is, *in whichever person* He freely wills; “and you hear His voice,” that is, in Scripture. For Christ says to His disciples (Matthew 10:20): “It is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who is in heaven.”

“And you do not know where He comes from,” that is, by what merit He has come; “or where He goes,” that is, where He finally leads the one who has been baptized. “So it is,” again, unknown even to himself, “with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”

Nicodemus, burdened in his understanding by Jesus’ words, asks again: “How can these things be?” And the merciful Master gently rebukes him in three ways.

First, He rebukes him for his ignorance: “You are a teacher in Israel”—that is, among the Jewish people—“and you do not understand these things!” As if He said: “Your ignorance is your shame, because a teacher of the Old Law ought to understand this.”

Why, Nicodemus, do you not understand, when God says through Ezekiel (36:25): “I will pour clean water on you, and you will be cleansed from all your uncleanness”? And Zechariah, Nicodemus, says (13:1): “A fountain will be opened for the house of Judah and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to wash away sins.”

Ah, Jewish teacher Nicodemus, do you not understand that cleansing from all sins must come from an opened fountain—the opened side of Christ—from which water flowed like from a generous spring for the washing away of sins?

Nicodemus, do you not understand that Ezekiel (47:2) saw waters flowing from the right side? And what is that right side from which the waters flowed but the Son of God? For Ezekiel goes on to say (47:9) that “every living soul that moves, wherever the torrent goes, will live,” and again, “Everything to which the water of this torrent comes will live.”

What else did Ezekiel see in the Holy Spirit except that all to whom, in its power, the water came—that water which flowed from Christ on the cross—were all made alive spiritually, being born of the Holy Spirit and of that water?

**F.**

Second, Nicodemus deserves rebuke because he first praised Christ and said, “We know that you have come from God as a teacher,” and now he still doubts what Christ tells him.

So Christ says to him: “Truly, truly, I tell you: we”—that is, I and My apostles—“speak what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, and you do not receive our testimony; you Jews, especially you priests and teachers of the Law.”

Third, Nicodemus is rebuked because Christ had set before him easy matters, and he still did not understand. Therefore Christ says: “Since I have told you earthly things”—that is, easy things—“about how people, made from earth, are born spiritually, and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things, such as My eternal birth from God the Father and about the Holy Trinity?”

Thus Nicodemus is rebuked for this: having reason already to believe the easier truths, he still delays in believing the greater truths.

And when Jesus saw that later Nicodemus and those like him would receive the deeper mysteries of faith, He went on to speak about His ascension into heaven, which would happen after His incarnation and His life among the people. He said: “No one goes up into heaven except the One who came down from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven.”

It is as if He said: “No one goes up into heaven—into heavenly joy—by his own power, except the Son of Man, whom you call the Messiah. He came down from heaven—that is, He took flesh—yet in His divinity He is always in heaven.”

So the Savior teaches Nicodemus that He, being God, took flesh and lives among men, and that by His own power He will ascend into heaven as the Son of Man. Therefore, by his own power, no other man goes into heaven; rather, everyone who will be in heaven will be drawn there by Christ’s power as a member of His body, He being the Head.

**G.**

Know that when Christ says that the Son of Man came down from heaven, many heretics have taken it to mean that the Son of God took His body in heaven and thus came down bodily from heaven and passed through the womb of the Virgin Mary. According to that falsehood, painters too often depict the angel greeting Mary with a tiny child above her, as if He were coming down from heaven into her. That way of painting may have been thought up by such heretics.

But people must not believe that the Son of God moved from one place to another away from heaven when He became flesh. He was everywhere, and is everywhere still, in His divinity. So, being both in His divinity and in grace present in the womb of the Virgin Mary, as soon as she agreed and said (Luke 1:38), “Let it be done to me according to your word,” the Son of God at once became incarnate in her and became a true man.

And because Christ’s crucifixion is necessary both for faith and for salvation, and because it was foretold in the Old Testament by a figure, Christ finally teaches Nicodemus this figure. Nicodemus was a teacher of the Old Law, who ought to understand what these figures mean. Therefore Christ says: “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up.”

Understand it this way: when the Jewish people in the desert murmured against God (Numbers 21), God sent against them fiery serpents—very cruel and poisonous. They bit the people so that many were dying. Then many came to Moses and said, “We have sinned against God and against you. Pray that He would take the serpents away from us.” Moses prayed to God for the people, and God said to him: “Make a bronze serpent and set it up on a pole as a sign. Whoever is bitten and looks at it will live.”

So Moses made a bronze serpent and set it up on a sign where all could see it, and those who had been bitten by the serpents, when they looked at it, were healed.

This is what is written in the book of Numbers, the fourth book of Moses in the Old Testament—read chapter 21.

This figure—this picture—Jesus brings before Nicodemus. Just as Moses lifted up the serpent on a pole so that those who had been bitten by the serpents could see it and so be healed and not die, so the Son of Man had to be lifted up on the cross, so that those who had been bitten in their souls by the hellish serpent through sin would not die forever.

Therefore Christ says: “So that everyone who believes in Him”—with a living faith unto death—“will not perish” forever, “but will have eternal life,” that is, fullness and satisfaction without lack in everlasting joy.

Just as those bitten by the serpents, believing that God had given the bronze serpent for their healing from bodily death, and looking upon it, were healed from death and from their pain, so we, believing that the Son of Man, Jesus, was given to us by God and hung upon the cross so that we might look to Him with faith and hope and love, will be delivered from eternal death.

And just as the bronze serpent looked like it had poison, though it had none—for it was bronze—so the Son of God took on the appearance of sinful flesh, since He was truly man, yet He had no sin; and as God He could not suffer or die, just as the bronze serpent could not feel pain or die.

Thus our dear Savior very well taught Nicodemus—and through him, us—about baptism, His incarnation, His suffering, and His ascension into heaven.

These four points every Christian must hold:

First, that without baptism a person cannot be saved;  
second, that Christ, the Son of God, took flesh and is therefore true God and true man;  
third, that He was crucified for sinners;  
and fourth, that He ascended into heaven and that, therefore, He will take His chosen ones, who believe in Him, to Himself into eternal life.

May this dear and faithful Master—who so gently, kindly, and gloriously taught Nicodemus, and us after him, the true faith—lead us quickly out of this miserable life into that life, and help us to it. He is blessed forever.
