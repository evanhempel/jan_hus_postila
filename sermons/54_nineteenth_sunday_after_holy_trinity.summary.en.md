This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon on Matthew chapter 9, verses 1-8, where Jesus heals a paralyzed man and forgives his sins. The sermon emphasizes Christ's divine authority, the faith of those who brought the sick man, and the Pharisees' wrongful accusation of blasphemy.

- **Christ's Compassion and Power**  
  - Jesus demonstrates both mercy and divine authority by healing the paralyzed man and forgiving his sins.
  - He prioritizes spiritual healing ("your sins are forgiven") before physical healing ("rise and walk").

- **The Faith of the People**  
  - The men who carried the paralyzed man showed great faith, which Jesus acknowledged.  
  - The crowds glorified God after witnessing the miracle.

- **Pharisees' Accusation of Blasphemy**  
  1. The Pharisees wrongly accuse Jesus of blasphemy for claiming authority to forgive sins.  
  2. Jan Hus explains three types of blasphemy:  
     - Denying what belongs to God (e.g., rejecting Christ's divinity).  
     - Attributing sin to God (e.g., claiming God can lie).  
     - Giving divine power to creatures (e.g., priests claiming to create Christ's body in the Eucharist).  

- **Christ's Response**  
  - Jesus, knowing their thoughts, proves His divine authority by healing the man physically.  
  - The miracle confirms that the "Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins."

> **Key Quote:**  
> *"What is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise and walk’? But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins—he then said to the paralytic—‘Rise, take up your bed and go home.’"* (Matthew 9:5-6)
