This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon on Matthew 8:23-27, where Jesus calms the storm. Hus explains the spiritual lessons behind this miracle, emphasizing faith, prayer, and trust in God during life's trials.

### Key Points:
1. **Reasons for Jesus entering the boat**:
   - To rest with His disciples.
   - To teach the importance of prayer and devotion.
   - To avoid worldly praise (fleeing when people wanted to make Him king).

2. **Purpose of the storm**:
   - To strengthen the disciples' faith in Christ's divinity.
   - To demonstrate His humanity (sleeping).
   - To teach reliance on prayer in distress.
   - To expose weak faith (disciples' fear).

3. **Lessons on faith**:
   - Lack of faith leads to sin (referencing 2 Timothy 2:13 and James 2:26).
   - Doubt makes people prone to sin (thinking God may not punish).
   - A plea for increased faith (Luke 17:5).

4. **Spiritual allegory**:
   - The boat symbolizes hope in crossing life's turbulent "sea" (worldly trials).
   - Storms represent temptations; the sea's waves symbolize worldly honors that rise and fall.
   - Warning against "sleeping" (indulging in fleshly pleasures or pride).

5. **Exhortation**:
   - Trust God amid trials, call on Him, and avoid despair.
   - Pride leads to a greater fall: "The higher they climb, the harder they fall."

> **Key Quote**:  
> "Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?" (Matthew 8:26). Hus explains: "If they had fully believed He was true God, they would have known He could perform miracles asleep or awake—for divinity never sleeps."
