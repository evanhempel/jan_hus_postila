# Sunday Called The Ninth

Reading from Matthew 20:1–16.

At that time our Lord Jesus spoke this parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man, a landowner, who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. When he had agreed with the workers for the wage of a coin for the day, he sent them into his vineyard. Going out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace, and he said to them, ‘You also go into my vineyard, and I will give you whatever is right.’ So they went. Again he went out about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same. And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and said to them, ‘Why are you standing here idle all day?’ They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You also go into my vineyard.’ When evening came, *cum sero factum esset*, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, ‘Call the workers and give them their pay, beginning with the last up to the first.’ When those came who had worked only the eleventh hour, they each received a coin. And when the first came, they supposed they would receive more; but they also received each a coin. And when they received it, they grumbled against the master of the house, saying, ‘These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the heat.’ But he answered one of them, ‘Friend, I am not doing you wrong. Did you not agree with me for a coin? Take what is yours and go. I choose to give to this last one as I give to you. Am I not allowed to do what I want with what is mine? Or is your eye evil because I am good?’ So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but not many are chosen.”

Our gracious Savior, in these words, teaches that many people are called to salvation, but few are chosen. He stirs up those who are willing workers, so that they will labor boldly in his vineyard. He gives comfort to the slow and latecomers, so they will not despair. And he teaches those who have worked long in his vineyard not to become proud, and not to despise those who have only recently come into the work.

He speaks in a parable and says: “The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner.” In this passage, the “kingdom of heaven” means the Son of God himself, as was said in the reading just before this. He is the head of the whole holy church, which is his vineyard. He is the master of this vineyard. And he relates to it in a way that is somewhat like how a human owner—an ordinary man, not Christ—relates to his earthly, physical vineyard.

This master goes out five times to bring workers into that vineyard—that is, into the militant holy church, the gathering of the elect while they are still here as fighters, standing with Christ against the world, the flesh, and the devil.

The church is called a vineyard by way of a picture, because it is meant to bear fruit. In this vineyard there is, in the middle, one root from which all the branches sprout, grow, take in their sap, and bear fruit. About this root he himself says in John 15: “I am the true vine, and you are the branches.” This root is at the same time the master of the vineyard. He sits in his house, in the holy triumphant church in heaven. There he does not work in the vineyard, but sits forever with those who at last receive the coin for their work.

This master first “went out early in the morning” to bring workers into his vineyard. As Gregory the Great says, this vineyard is the holy church, which, from the first righteous Abel to the very last person who will be born at the end of the world, has given birth to as many saints as branches have grown from that vine. That is Gregory.

From that, understand this: the holy church, Christ’s vineyard, is the assembly of all the elect—from the very first saint to the very last, who will complete the number of the chosen. I have written about this more fully in my little books on the holy church.

The Son of God meant to plant this vineyard. “He went out early in the morning”—that is, in the first age of the world. He gave commands to the angels; and he himself, in his own person, although not yet in the flesh, first urged the fathers of that first age to work faithfully for the good of this vineyard—just as we know about Adam, Seth, Enoch, and others of the first age.

The agreement about the wage is God’s promise of “the daily coin,” which stands for blessedness, the final happiness that the faithful workers will receive in the end. It is called a “coin” for three reasons.

First, for its permanence. A coin is made of something solid that lasts; so blessedness is something permanent, that lasts forever.

Second, because a coin is round, with no beginning or end in its circle. In the same way, the workers’ reward—who is God himself, eternal—has neither beginning nor end.

Third, because of the inscription. A coin has writing engraved on bright silver or gold. Likewise, in God’s godhead, in its brightness, by a kind of likeness, there is written out for the blessed to read the order and arrangement of the things that the Lord God has, in power, wisdom, and free will, created for the comfort of all his faithful ones.

Then, in the second age of the world, as if at the third hour of the day, he went out and saw many people idle. He stirred them up, not only by his inner breathing and instruction, but also by the exhortation of angels. We see this in Noah, Eber, Terah, and Abraham, who worked faithfully in that second age.

Again he went out in the third and fourth ages and did the same, as we see in the faithful from Abraham to David, and from David to the deliverance of the Jews from Babylon. And then, from that Babylonian return until the public coming of Christ, the reading of Scripture passes over that time almost like a barren stretch; because in those years the priests, having given themselves to greed and neglecting the people who stood idle, mismanaged the vineyard of the great Master. Christ the Master testifies this against them in Matthew 21:33–41.

Finally, in the eleventh hour the Master, the Son of God, went out in the flesh and urged the people to work faithfully, as the holy fathers had done before.

Now notice that holy teachers explain these five goings-out of the Master in different ways. Some explain them as I have just done: by the ages of the world before the Son of God took flesh. Others explain them by the five ages of each person’s life. In every age of our life we receive some kind of warning and stirring to work usefully toward salvation.

By “morning” we can understand childhood, which lasts until about the age of fourteen. This is the first age for working in the holy vineyard. About this age the Savior says in Mark 10:14: “Let the little children come to me.”

The second age is youth, from about fourteen to twenty‑eight. In that age boys and girls must be especially careful, because—like the third hour of the day when the heat increases—the heat of lust and vanity rises in them most strongly. In that age was that young man who said to Christ in Matthew 19 that he had kept all the commandments from his youth.

The third age is manhood, signified by the ninth hour, running from about twenty‑eight to forty‑eight years. In that age people are nearing the declining of their strength. This is also the age that people commonly throw away in vanity.

And to show that in these three ages people often sin by not working rightly, Christ our God, while he was in the flesh and working here, raised three people from the dead: a little girl in childhood (Matthew 9:25), a young man, the son of a widow, in youth (Luke 7:15), and Lazarus in manhood (John 11:44).

Then the eleventh hour stands for old age, from about forty‑eight to seventy years. Many in that age stand idle, doing nothing of what Christ, the Master of the vineyard, has commanded. Yet even them the merciful Master calls, wanting to give them whatever is just.

The sixth age is the remainder of life from seventy to death, and it is called feebleness, from which feeble old women get their name. Through these ages people run. One age is passed over in this reading: the very first stage, infancy, from birth until the child first begins to grasp what evil is. This age is left out because the person is not yet bound to work in the vineyard; in that time he neither earns anything for salvation nor sins by his own conscious act.

With this explanation Gregory the Great agrees. He says that each person is brought into a good life at a different hour: some in childhood, some in youth, some in manhood, some in old age, some in feebleness. Therefore each is called at a different hour to work in the vineyard.

So, brothers and sisters, look carefully at your own way of life and see whether you are God’s workers. Let each one weigh what he is doing and ask: “Am I already working in God’s vineyard?” For whoever is still seeking his own advantage in this life has not yet come into God’s vineyard. Those are the ones who truly work for the Lord: they are not seeking their own gain, but their Master’s gain; with the zeal of love they look for the profit of souls, and they are eager to bring others along with themselves.

Whoever lives for himself, whoever feeds his body with pleasures, that person is, rightly, an idle man deserving punishment, because he does not follow the profit of God’s work. And whoever waits until the last age of life before he begins to live for God has stood idle until the eleventh hour.

Rightly, then, it is said to the idle ones: “Why are you standing here all day long doing nothing?” As if the Lord were saying plainly: “Even though you did not want to live for God in childhood and youth, at least in your last age, look to the paths of life. There will not be much work left that you can do—yet at least come in the evening.” This is Gregory again.

Now know this: the watchmen and chief workers in Christ’s vineyard ought to be the priests, above all. To them, especially in the apostles, the Master said, as we read in John 15:16: “I have appointed you to go and bear fruit.” They should increase that vineyard by holy example and good teaching. They ought to dig around the vines by rooting out heresies and errors. They should graft and plant by teaching what is good. And they must tie up the branches, strengthening them with hope of salvation.

Blessed are those who work so in the vineyard! But woe to those who, after making an agreement to work in this way, do more harm by their evil deeds!

About such men the bishops and priests and teachers of the law themselves already gave a verdict, when Christ asked them what the owner would do to the tenants when he came. They said: “He will bring those wretches to a miserable end and will give his vineyard to other tenants” (Matthew 21:41).

About such priests Hugh says in the book *De 12 abusionibus*: “Our priests are idle; they are full of drunkenness. They sniff after earthly things, always in the streets, rarely in the churches. Slow to see the sin in a man, quick to find a hare’s track. They would rather gather dogs than the poor; they would more quickly give bread to a dog than to a poor man. More servants wait on them at table than at the altar. They have many pages and few pupils. Their beds are better prepared than the church, their tables more ready than the altar, their cups more precious than the chalice, their horses more costly than the missal, their fine capes lovelier than the chasuble, their soft shirts more luxurious than the alb. And what is worst of all: their outer garments are cleaner than the corporals on which the body of God lies.” That is what Hugh says; do not be angry with me for repeating it.

Woe to us priests, if we do not work bravely in that vineyard! For the Master says to the idle: “Why are you standing here all day doing nothing?” And do we not know that Paul says in 2 Thessalonians 3:10: “If anyone is not willing to work, he should not eat”?

Gregory says: “What shall we teachers say to this, we who, before the day of judgment, take on the office of the holy church and eat the bread of the silent?” And Bernard says: “They will come, they will come, before the judgment seat of the Judge; there the heavy complaint of the orphans and widows will be heard, and the hard proof will be that we have eaten their goods and have not wiped away their sins.”

But rectors and bishops and others have their excuse ready. They say, “I have a vicar; what is done through another is as if I had done it myself.” Bernard answers that: “He who has a vicar in the work will have a vicar in the reward.” For Paul says in 1 Corinthians 3:8: “Each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.” Notice: each according to “his own,” not according to his vicar’s. Even if a pastor had a thousand vicars, each vicar has enough to do for himself, and the pastor is still bound to work himself. If he cannot bear the whole load, then he ought to have a faithful helper.

And without doubt, when a priest neglects his place, at once he has the devil as his vicar, who carefully notes every failure that happens through that negligence. The priest may not know this now, but he will know it on the day of judgment.

And the excuse they use—like saying that a blacksmith has tongs so that he will not burn himself in the fire, and so a pastor or bishop has a vicar so that he will not be burned in the eternal fire or even in purgatory—has an easy answer: the devil will leave the tongs and seize the blacksmith himself.

If a steward truly works faithfully with the people, he will receive a reward for his own work, and the pastor will always have to give an account that he himself has been idle.

In my opinion, the faithful parish chaplains in the church are more useful than many of today’s prelates, because they carry most of the priestly office: they baptize, they preach, they celebrate mass, they hear confessions. And if they are not greedy, but, having food and clothing, do not chase after more, then they are followers of the apostles. The same I say about good parish priests. As far as I see, they are the ones who work best in God’s vineyard.

But the great prelates—pope, cardinals, and other men of the court—most of them only busy themselves with selling church income. Archbishops and bishops are taken up with ruling their lordships. Canons mostly feed themselves. Chaplains who never preach, after rushing through mass, usually go singing, playing, or to the tavern. Rich monks lock themselves in and feast well. And if they are mendicants, they run around, trying to squeeze as much as they can from the people.

But understand: I do not mean the good among them. I hold this: in whatever state a person truly loves God and keeps his commandments, that person is precious to God as a faithful servant. Yet some benefit the holy church more than others. And none of them will go without reward. For the reading says: “When evening came, the master of the vineyard said to his steward: ‘Call the workers and give them their wage.’”

That “evening” means, as the commentators say, the end of the world, or the end of each person’s life. “The Lord said”—this is the Godhead, God himself—“to the steward,” that is, to Christ the man, who planted his vineyard with his own blood, sweat, and death: “Call the workers!” About this calling Christ says in John 5:25: “The hour is coming when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God.” That voice will be: “Rise, you dead, and come to judgment!”

“And give them their wage”—that is, what they have earned. For Scripture says in 1 Corinthians 3:8 that he will give to each according to his works.

“Beginning with the last.” Here understand that Christ will begin with the last, that is, with his apostles, who came into the vineyard in the eleventh hour, in the last age of the world. To them he promised in Matthew 19:28: “You who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”

Yet all who were called in those five hours and worked faithfully will receive one and the same kind of reward: one blessedness. The reading says: “They each received a coin,” meaning that this “coin” of reward, blessedness, is paid out equally to all—even though some saints will have greater honor than others. In this way the “first” can mean the most honorable, such as the apostles; the “last” can mean those saints who have the least measure of merit.

The reading goes on: “When the first saw this”—some Bibles say, “When the first had come”—“they thought they would receive more; but they also received each a coin. And after receiving it, they grumbled.”

Here there are two hard sayings. First, that the first workers “thought” they would receive more. Second, that “they grumbled.” How can this be? How could saints be mistaken in their thoughts and grumble?

It is certain that no saint will, on the day of judgment, accuse God of doing him wrong. No one will have even the thought that he ought to receive more than God, of his grace, gives him. Therefore Gregory says: “We may ask: why is it said that they grumbled? Those who are called, even if late, into the kingdom—it is certain that no one receives the kingdom of heaven by grumbling, and no one who receives it can grumble.”

And he answers at once: “The holy fathers, however justly they lived before the coming of the Lord—that is, before Christ—were not led into the kingdom until he came down who, by laying down his life, opened the closed paradise to men. So their ‘grumbling’ is that they say that, although they have now received the kingdom, they were kept long from it. For those who, after finishing their righteous life, were received into the place of the underworld—even if it was a quiet place—truly had both hard work in the vineyard and this ‘grumbling.’ So it is as if, after grumbling, those who came to the joys of heaven after a long time in the underworld receive their coin. But we who have come in the eleventh hour, we do not grumble after our work, but receive the coin. For after the death of Christ—that is, after his coming into this world—we are led into the kingdom as soon as we go out of the body, and we receive it without delay.”

This is Gregory. In short, he means that the saints before Christ’s birth went into a place of darkness, a prison, and could not at once go to heaven, even if they were worthy, because Christ had not yet opened heaven. While they were in that darkness, they still worked in the vineyard. And when they saw how long their freedom was delayed, they “wondered” about it—as if they grumbled. But Christians, if they live well in this last age, when they die go at once to the heavenly kingdom, without imprisonment, as if “without grumbling.”

So Gregory takes the “thinking” and “grumbling” as a kind of holy wondering: the old saints pondering in their hearts how long they had been in that prison, and how they had thought they might have been set free sooner. And that they could think and wonder in this way without sin.

Then comes the answer of the Master. He “answered one of them,” that is, the whole group of those ancient saints, and said: “Friend, I am not doing you wrong.” All that follows—those words that sound like rebuke—is really an explanation to show God’s justice and his mercy. He shows and declares that he will give to each person mercifully and justly, as he pleases.

Since no one has earned from him even his own soul and body—he has given them to each person purely out of his great grace—it is completely clear that when he gives a man the gift of the Holy Spirit and the joy of heaven, he does not wrong him at all, but shows him great mercy by giving him eternal life.

Know that this part of the reading about the “grumbling” is very difficult, just as many parts of Scripture are. I know that I do not understand it, and I do not reject what Gregory says. But it seems to me that God would not say to any saint, for a mere sinless wondering, “Your eye is evil”—that is, “Your intention is crooked or wicked,” as Jerome explains the words, “Is your eye evil?” Jerome says it means: “Is my goodness to you the cause of your evil?”

And since the grumblers spoke as if the steward had done them wrong, that is shown by the steward’s words: “Friend, I am not doing you wrong.” So again I confess that I do not fully understand this.

Gregory holds that this “grumbling”—that is, wondering—belonged to the holy fathers until they were led out of prison. But the text says: “After receiving the coin they grumbled.” First they received, then they grumbled. That seems to go against what Gregory says.

Again, if the calling of the workers refers to the day of judgment, how could the ancient fathers, after their reward, still wonder why they had been kept so long in prison? I do not know whether it can rightly be understood in that way.

Perhaps we might understand it like this: that if anyone, after receiving his reward, were to grumble, then the steward could answer every such grumbler: “Friend, I am not doing you wrong,” and so on. With that understanding, Christ would be leading the whole parable to this point: that people should work bravely in the holy church and, as they work, should not imagine that they will receive the kingdom of heaven as if by legal right, but rather from God’s great grace.

For in himself, by himself, a man cannot deserve anything from God. The more he serves God, the more he actually owes God—because it is God who gives him the ability to serve so much. The better a person is toward God, the more he is in God’s debt, since God has given him more goodness.

So there will be no grumbling among the saints. Or again, we might understand it this way: as long as the saints are still here and suffer much, they may, in their sorrow, say that they are bearing the burden and the heat, and in hope they have already “received” their reward after death. In the end, I rest in this: every word of Christ is true; what I do not understand, I commend to his mercy, hoping that after death I will understand.

Finally Christ says: “So the last will be first,” meaning that Christians will, in reward, be more honored than the holy Jews, because in a short time, with Christ’s help, standing against great cruelty of the devil, they earn more than the people of the Old Testament did in a long time.

It can also be understood this way: the “last,” that is, those most despised in this world, will be first because of their humility and other virtues. And the “first,” the most honored in this world, if they do not serve God as they should, will be last—so that a despised little lord in this world will outrun popes and bishops in reward, and a peasant outrun emperor and king. For Christ says in Luke 14:11 and 18:14: “Whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”

So Gregory the Pope says here: “Although we may know what kind of good we have done and how great it is, we still do not know how the heavenly Judge will weigh it.” Therefore let each one joyfully work, so that at least he may be among the very last in the kingdom of God. Amen.
