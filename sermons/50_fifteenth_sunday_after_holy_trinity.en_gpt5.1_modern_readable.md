title: Fifteenth Sunday After Holy Trinity
---

At that time Jesus said: No one can properly serve two masters who are opposed to each other; for either he will hate the one [the devil] and love the other [God], or he will put up with the one [the devil] and look down on the other [God]. You cannot serve God and money (*mammonae*, possessions). Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your soul, that is, your life, about what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear. Is not your soul worth more than food, and your body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the sky: they do not sow or reap or gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them; and you are worth much more than they are. And which of you, by anxious thought, can add a single cubit to his height? And why are you anxious about clothing? Notice the lilies of the field [the many kinds of flowers], how they grow for their own adornment: they do not toil or spin. Yet I tell you, even Solomon, that powerful, wise, and rich king, in all his royal splendor, was not clothed as beautifully in shining white as one of these flowers. So if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, you of little faith, if you give yourselves to disordered worry. Therefore, since this is so, do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, What shall we wear? For the pagans, who have no faith, run after all these things. Your heavenly Father surely knows that you need all of them. Therefore, trusting him and relying on him not to abandon you, seek first—be most diligent to seek—the kingdom of God [the joy of heaven] and his righteousness [every kind of virtue that leads to the heavenly kingdom], and all these things [what is needed for life] will be added to you in due measure.

**A.** Our merciful Savior, by this holy teaching, is pulling his faithful ones away from the evil love of earthly things and drawing them to love the things of heaven. First, he commands them not to serve possessions. Second, he commands them not to pour disordered effort into bodily things. Third, he commands them, trusting in their heavenly Father, to seek the heavenly kingdom first of all. And even though the Savior spoke this holy and very useful commandment for our salvation, Saint Luke writes in chapter 16, verse 14, that when the lawyers—who were greedy men—heard it, they made fun of him. Saint Bede says this: Christ had already warned those teachers and lawyers not to put their trust in their own righteousness, but to receive sinners who repented and to redeem their sins by almsgiving; and yet they mocked the very one who commanded mercy, humility, and sobriety. That is why Saint Luke says that when those greedy lawyers heard this, they mocked him—for two reasons: first, as if he were ordering them to do things that were completely useless, and second, as if he were commanding them in vain, because, in their own eyes, they had already done everything. So speaks Saint Bede. And the state of many teachers, priests, and lawyers today is no different from theirs, for this same reading is a joke among them as it was among those men. And those of today mock Christ even worse than they did, because they at least openly rejected his words, while these do it under a cloak. Some say they obey this teaching; others, by their deeds and their speech, oppose him. Both groups kiss him at the mass, but they will not let go of their greed. In this way they pretend to be disciples of Christ but are in fact followers of Judas, who heard this same reading from Christ and then, out of greed, betrayed Christ with a kiss. But it was not so with Peter, the other apostles, and their true followers. They cast away lordship and greed; if they had something to drink and eat and a decent garment for their work, they were content with that. They obeyed Christ in this reading: they sought the kingdom of heaven first; they themselves lived well and taught others to do the same. Thus they served one Lord above all—God—who says: “No one can serve two masters.”

**B.** Understand that Christ is talking about two masters who oppose each other in their rule, and about true, ordered service; and he teaches that no one can rightly serve two opposing masters at the same time. As Christ himself gives the example when he says, “You cannot serve God and money,” even the simplest sensible person knows this: a person cannot at the same time rightly and reasonably direct his desire both to God and to money. It must be one or the other: either his desire, with full agreement of his will, leans more toward God than toward money, or else it leans more toward money than toward God. And wherever his will leans more, that is where his service goes. So, if the greater desire with consent of the will is toward God, then the service belongs to God and not to money. But if the greater desire is toward money rather than God—and therefore away from salvation—then that person is serving money and not God. Christ measures this service by focused desire when he says, “Do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat,” and there he forbids excessive desire. And when he says, “Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness,” there he commands that the greatest desire be directed to God, who is the kingdom of the chosen, and to the righteousness of the kingdom, that is, every virtue that leads to the heavenly kingdom. Therefore, whoever wants to know whom he serves most should turn his mind on himself and weigh where his effort, his care, is most directed, and he will immediately see whom he truly serves. For example: Peter has two masters, John and Přibík. If Peter serves John more eagerly and diligently than Přibík, then Peter serves John more than Přibík. In the same way, if Peter has two women he loves—Catherine and Margaret—and he desires Catherine more eagerly than Margaret, then he loves Catherine more than Margaret. Now, you miser, judge for yourself: where has your desire and effort turned more strongly? There is your master; there is the one you serve.

And it is not fitting—indeed, it is impossible in a proper way—that a person’s desire should lean as much, or more, toward any creature than toward God. For if he valued a creature more than God in his desire, at once he would be valuing God less than that creature, despising him and holding him in hatred. Therefore, it is impossible to serve God and money properly at the same time. That is why the Savior says, “You cannot serve God and money.” And when he begins this reading, he says, “No one can”—that is, no one can properly, rightly, lovingly—“serve two masters who oppose each other in their rule.” Know that these two are truly opposing masters, who draw human desire in opposite directions. Thus God and the devil are two masters opposed to each other, contrary and irreconcilable. God is the true Lord of all the world, because he created it and sustains it. He is especially Lord of mankind, because he created human beings, redeemed them with his own blood, feeds them, and will give them the kingdom of heaven if they truly serve him. He alone is Lord above all other lords. But the devil is not truly a lord, except as a robber; having no rightful claim over a person, so as to rule him in an ordered way, he drags under himself, by malice, whomever he can. Scripture also calls him king over all the sons of pride, as Saint Job says in chapter 40. And Christ says that he is the prince of this world—that is, of evil people in this world.

**C.** Now listen: if you want to serve some little poor master just so your belly can be full and you can have a thin coat on your back, you take trouble to find him, and when you come to him, you ask earnestly what you must do in his service—though that little master cannot give you anything unless the great Lord allows it. Brother, be eager instead for the best Lord, the most powerful, the richest, and the most generous. He is the best, who cannot do injustice and does not get angry without cause. He is the most powerful, whom no one can overcome, and who can defend his servant against every enemy. He is the richest, who has all things in his hand. And he is the most generous, for no one can reward his servant more richly for his service than he does; he gives his servant the kingdom of heaven and a joy so full that nothing more can rightly be desired. Brother, on the day of your baptism you gave yourself to this Lord; therefore serve him with diligence. He created you; he redeemed you with his own blood; he feeds you; he protects you from the devil; he feeds you with his body and gives you drink with his blood; when you turn back to him, he forgives your sins, bestows virtues, strengthens you in what is good, helps you to accomplish what is good, gladdens your heart, and where he himself is, there he wills that his servant finally be. So he is the truest and best Lord, and, as Saint Gregory says, to serve him is to reign.

Who, then, except a cursed fool, would refuse to be eager to serve such a Lord—especially when his service is so light? It is this: to love that Lord above all, and to love your neighbor. This service includes that a person not choose sin and that he love what is good. And the service is light because a person can fulfill it in a way that earns reward anywhere: in the open air, at sea, in prison, in stocks, in poverty, in sickness, even naked. As long as the soul remains in the body, a person can offer this service to God and for it receive the eternal kingdom, which is the fullness of joy without lack. Alas for people who pay no attention to the service of this Lord, and instead serve his enemy, the devil—the poorest, worst, most wretched, most cruel master. The devil makes his servants ugly and vile, robs them of virtue, weakens them in what is good, leads them into evil and strengthens them in it, kills the soul, and then torments them forever in darkness and fire. These two are opposing masters. It is impossible to serve them both at the same time. Therefore, those people deceive themselves who do not keep God’s commandments, and yet imagine that they serve him with fasting, almsgiving, prayers, or other works, while at the same time, by mortal sin, they are serving the devil. The Lord—who cannot lie—says, “No one can serve two masters.” No one can, in a right and loving way, at one and the same moment, serve together two opposing masters, “for he will hate the one,” namely the devil, “and love the other,” namely God; “or he will endure the one,” that is, the devil—Saint Luke in chapter 16, verse 13, says, he will “hold to” the one, and both are well said. For although the sinner does not say out loud that he loves the devil above God, yet he tolerates the devil ruling over him in wickedness, as this reading says, and by sin he clings to him, as Saint Luke says—“and despise the other,” that is, God. For everyone who sins mortally, by rejecting God’s commandment, sins out of pride and insults God.

Saint Augustine says this in a sermon *In omel*: “He says, ‘He will despise,’ and does not say, ‘He will hate’; for no conscience can bear the idea that it hates God. But he despises him—that is, he does not fear him—who does not keep his commandments.” So says Augustine.

**D.** Then the Savior continues and explains his own words: “You cannot serve God and money.” Here is the meaning: to serve possessions is to deny God. And note: in the Latin reading it says *mammonae*. Saint Jerome says that in the Syrian language *mammona* means “riches,” and that Mammon is also the name of the devil who leads people into sin through possessions. It seems to me, therefore, that the reading should be, “You cannot serve God and *mammonae*, that is, riches.” Christ’s own words show this, for he immediately says, “Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your soul, what you will eat.” So he touches on food and clothing, the two things on which all useful possessions for a person depend. For when a person is filled and warm, that ought to be enough for him. And since the Savior forbids disordered excess in these two things—food and clothing—which are most necessary for a person, how much more does he forbid excess in all other things.

**E.** To understand this reading more clearly, know that there are three kinds of service. The first is natural service, by which every creature must serve God, whether it wants to or not. The second is loving service, by which each person ought to serve everyone; and he does so when, being in God’s grace and serving God by good works, he also serves the angels and all the saints in heaven, those being prepared for heaven, and the faithful here on earth. The third kind of service is human service—that is, service invented by people—and that kind is often disordered. Yet most people rush after precisely that sort of service. This human service arises in three main ways. First, by conquest: some people force others under their control and place them in their service. Second, by free choice: one person voluntarily submits himself to another’s service in exchange for bodily payment. Third, by the unsuitability of a person for anything else: some people have a coarse nature fitted more for heavy work and labor than others. And this third reason most reasonably leads such a person to serve others who are more capable, both in bodily constitution and in understanding. For the wise philosopher Aristotle says that those people who are well endowed in judgment and mind are, by nature, lords and rulers over others.

**F.** Next, understand that there is a good kind of care and a bad kind of care. Good care is again of two sorts. First, there is the care by which a person eagerly and diligently directs himself to God, to virtues, and to spiritual works; this kind of care belongs to the God-centered life, which others call the spiritual life. This was the care of the apostles and their true followers. Second, there is a good but mixed care that a person has in a working life: he looks first to God, to virtues, and to good works, and then also takes on bodily labor. The first kind of care was in Mary Magdalene: she looked diligently to Jesus and listened to his word; leaving aside bodily work, she sat at his feet. The second kind of care was in Martha: she cared about Jesus and his disciples, about what she might give them to eat, but in that work she became troubled as she labored for bodily needs. Therefore the Savior said to her in Luke 10:41, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.” But apart from these two cares, any other kind of care is evil, where a person cares more about a lesser good than about a greater good—like the greedy, who care more about riches than about the kingdom of heaven, or like many who care more about sinning than about virtue: fornicators, drunkards, gluttons, gamblers, the proud, and liars. These evil cares the Savior forbids; but he does not forbid good care—indeed, he commands it. He says through Jeremiah, “Be careful to keep all the commandments that are written in the book of the law of Moses.” And Saint Paul says in Ephesians 4:3, “Be eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,” that is, in love. So when the Savior says, “Do not be anxious,” he forbids evil care, but he does not forbid good care or good works. That is why he does not say, “Do not work,” but, “Do not be anxious about your soul,” that is, about your life, “what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear; for your soul is more,” that is, more worthy and more precious to God, “than food, and the body is more,” that is, more precious, “than clothing.”

**G.** Notice here that the Savior sets before us three things that the heavenly Father has given to a person: the soul, the body, and what both need. The soul is to be subject to God alone; the body is to be subject to the soul; and possessions are to be subject to both soul and body, as right reason orders. Greedy people overturn this order, giving both soul and body over for the sake of possessions, as Judas did. Others also overturn this order when their bodies rule over their souls—like gluttons, fornicators, and others who yield their bodies to mortal sin. The Savior rejects two kinds of care: one he calls care for life, which is care about food; the other he calls care for the body, which is care about clothing. He rejects these two cares in this way: a person’s life is more noble, more precious, and therefore better than its food, and the body is better than its clothing, for both food and clothing exist finally for the sake of the person. And since God has given both soul and body and will not overturn the order he has himself established, he will also give food for life and clothing for the body. Therefore there must not be disordered anxiety about food and clothing. We ought instead to direct all our diligence to God, to virtue, and to virtuous deeds, so that we may please him; there our care should rest, for otherwise it is disordered. Any care that does not serve that one final goal—eternal joy—is unworthy. Care for life and for the body must be so measured that a person cares about food and clothing only as is fitting for his salvation.

From this you can see that those who are anxious to be rich, to be honored in the world, to dance, to produce revelry, or to engage in games that do not help toward salvation—all such people are, against this teaching of Christ, caring in a disordered way. Christ goes on to say, “Look at the birds of the air.” Saint Luke in chapter 12, verse 24, says, “Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, yet your heavenly Father feeds them.” Your Father, who created you, gives you life; and if you obey him, he will give you an inheritance—the kingdom of heaven. “Are you not of much more value,” that is, are you not worth far more “than they?” You are rational creatures, made for eternal joy; the birds are made for your sake, without reason, and they perish. “And which of you,” or, “who among you, by thinking, can add one cubit to his stature?” As if he were saying: No one can; this does not lie within your power. Saint Augustine says: It is by whose power and rule that our bodies came to their growth and attained their full height, by that same power they can also be clothed. It was not through your care that your body reached its present growth, and even if you wished, by thinking, to add one cubit to your height, you could not. Therefore entrust the care of your clothing to him by whose care your body has grown.

“And why are you anxious about clothing?” that is, why are you anxious in a disordered way? “Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not work or spin,” that is, they do not labor to adorn themselves. When he says “they do not work,” he condemns disordered male anxiety; and when he says “they do not spin,” he condemns disordered female anxiety. “Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory”—that is, though he was wise, rich, and powerful—“was clothed like one of these,” so beautifully in white.

**H.** In Latin it says, “Consider the lilies.” In Czech we do not have a proper word for *lilium*—it is a very white flower, whose whiteness Solomon could not match in his robes. And it seems to me that by “lilies” Christ means many kinds of flowers. That is why he says “lilies,” in the plural—that is, many blossoms, such as lilies, roses, violets, and other beautiful flowers. Therefore Saint Augustine says: What silk, what royal purple, what painted work of weavers can be compared to flowers? What is as red as a rose? What is as white as a lily? What purple surpasses the violet? So says Augustine.

“For if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith,” that is, you who have little faith if you are anxiously disordered? Augustine says: You, who are created in the likeness of God, destined for an eternal inheritance in heaven—will not your Creator provide what is necessary for you and not allow you to perish from nakedness? Then Christ continues: “Therefore”—that is, since this is so—“do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, What shall we wear? For the pagans seek after all these things,” since they do not have true faith and imagine that life is only here and now. Saint Augustine says that pagans are busy with these things because they do not care about the future life, but seek only temporal and present things—like beasts of the earth, sniffing around for these goods. As the prophet David says in Psalm 49:13, 21, “They have become like the cattle that have no understanding and have been made like them.” So says Augustine.

“Your Father knows that you need all these things.” Your Father—who cannot be lacking in power, in knowledge, or in good will—“knows” in what time and measure you need these things for your blessedness. Therefore, believing him and trusting that he will not abandon you, “seek first the kingdom of God,” that is, above all desire and be eager for the joy of heaven, “and his righteousness,” that is, every kind of virtue that leads to the heavenly kingdom, “and all these things,” meaning what is necessary for life and body, “will be added to you” in such measure as may help you toward the heavenly kingdom. The Savior sets three things before us: first, the kingdom, which we must seek first; second, righteousness, which leads to that kingdom; third, bodily necessities. In this he shows that the kingdom of heaven is the highest good and therefore must be first in our desire; righteousness, by which a person comes to that kingdom, must be second in our desire; and third—last of all—come food and clothing, as the least. May the dear Savior grant that we desire most of all the joy of the eternal kingdom, and that by seeking it, as Christ commands, we may finally attain it. Amen.
