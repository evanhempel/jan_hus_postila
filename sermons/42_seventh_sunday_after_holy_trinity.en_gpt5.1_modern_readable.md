# Seventh Sunday After Holy Trinity

Saint Mark, chapter 8, verses 1–9

In those days, when a great crowd was with Jesus and they had nothing to eat, he called his disciples and said to them: “I feel compassion for the crowd, because they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. And if I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, and some of them have come from far away.” His disciples answered him, “From where could anyone feed these people with bread here in the wilderness?” He asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven.” He commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground. Taking the seven loaves, and giving thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd. They also had a few small fish; he blessed them and told the disciples to set these before them as well. They ate and were satisfied, and they picked up seven baskets of the pieces that were left over. Those who had eaten were about four thousand people, and he sent them away.

A.

According to this reading, our Savior shows that he is true God and true man.

He shows he is God, because he fed a great crowd with only a few loaves.

He shows he is man, because he lived among people in a real, human body.

He also shows his diligence for our salvation: he preached for three days out in the wilderness. And he shows his mercy when he says, “I feel compassion for the crowd.”

He gives a lesson as well to spiritual and earthly rulers.

First, he teaches rulers — both church leaders and secular lords — to ask counsel before they try to do something truly useful. The reading says: “He called his disciples and said to them, ‘I feel compassion for the crowd.’” The explanation is this: he calls his disciples together so that he may teach those in high position to seek the advice of those under them.

Second, he teaches that princes, lords, and prelates must be merciful to their people, and in time of need give them food so that they do not perish. And priests especially, with the bread that has been entrusted to them for almsgiving, should first put it before the poor.

Third, he teaches that the leftovers are to be gathered and given to the poor so they do not starve.

But now, people would rather give those leftovers to dogs or to pigs than to Christ’s poor members. By doing this they show that their dogs are dearer to them than the poor!

That is the lesson from the reading, according to the surface meaning of the words.

The spiritual teaching is this: a bishop, a pastor, or any priest set over the people must, like Christ, be diligent in preaching. He must set the word of God before the people, so that they do not perish on the road they must travel toward eternal joy.

And the people should “endure with him for three days.” That means, as Saint Augustine says, that they should turn away from sin, and turn to God in thought, in speech, and in action. For the merciful Savior does not want to send such people home hungry and without nourishment, lest they collapse and perish on the road.

Those who have been converted and are doing penance would on the road of this world surely perish if they did not feed on the word of God. Therefore they must be admonished and strengthened by God’s word. This is what Augustine teaches.

And again he says something like this: O that you would say, Lord Jesus, about us: “I do not want the hungry to perish.” But be pleased to give us food, so that we may be able to walk the road that leads to the heavenly homeland. For many perish on that road — all except those who feed from your table. This also is from Augustine.

Saint Augustine also points out that the Savior says: “If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, for some of them have come from far away.”

B.

And he explains it like this: This gracious word, spoken from the mouth of Truth, must be taken very seriously: “Some of them have come from far away.”

There is a person who has never tasted any crookedness and has never known bodily corruption, but has hurried eagerly into the service of God. That person has not come from far away, because by innocence and purity he has been very near to God.

Another person, stained by no filth and no great wickedness, having only experienced the state of marriage, then turns to the service of God. He also has not come from far away, because he used marriage in a permitted way and did not wander into unworthy things.

But there are others who return to repentance after bodily sins, some after false oaths, some after theft, some after murders. They turn back and give themselves to the service of almighty God.

Truly, those people are returning to the Lord from far away! For the more a person has wandered, the farther he has gone from the Lord.

The prodigal son, who left his father, went into a far country where he fed swine — that is, he fed his sins.

Therefore, food must be given even to those who come from far away. Converted sinners must be given the food of holy teaching, so that they may be strengthened in God and regain the strength they lost through their sins. The more they are weakened by sin, the more they must be fed by preachers with holy instruction, since they have now returned again.

All this is from Saint Augustine. And the same understanding is given by Saint Bede and Saint Remigius.

May the merciful Savior grant that those who are “from far away” — that is, from great sins — may no longer perish. And may those who have not yet come to Jesus return to him and eat his spiritual bread: his word and his body.

Let them be with him for three days — that is, let them have true faith, hope, and love toward him. Then, sitting down on the ground — that is, suppressing their bodily desires — they will eat from the seven loaves; that is, they will share in the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, which the merciful Savior gives, granting to each one according to his will.

Then every chosen one, fully satisfied, will rest with him in joy forever. Amen.
