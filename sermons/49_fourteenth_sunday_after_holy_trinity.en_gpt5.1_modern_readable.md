# Fourteenth Sunday After Holy Trinity

From the Gospel of Luke, chapter 17, verses 11–19.

At that time, as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he walked between Samaria and Galilee. And as he was entering a certain town, ten men with leprosy came to meet him. They stood at a distance and lifted up their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!” When he saw them, he said, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And as they were going, they were cleansed. And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice. He fell on his face at Jesus’ feet, giving him thanks. And this man was a Samaritan. Then Jesus said to him, “Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? Has no one been found to return and give glory to God except this foreigner?” And he said to him, “Get up and go! Your faith has made you well.”

A. In this reading we hear about Jesus, about the ten lepers, and about the priests.

In Jesus this reading shows work, great power, and mercy. His *work* is that, as he walked between a pagan land and a Jewish land, he preached the word of God. The reading says: “As Jesus was going to Jerusalem, he passed between Samaria”—that is a pagan land—“and Galilee”—a Jewish land. His mercy is shown both in that preaching and in his healing of the lepers. And his divine power is also revealed in that healing.

In the lepers we see great misery common to all, a good beginning common to all, but in the end gratitude only in one and ingratitude in the nine. About the priests the reading says nothing openly, yet we may suppose this: that being enemies of Christ’s law, they did not command those who were cleansed to go back to Jesus and give him thanks for having mercifully healed them.

The reading says, “As Jesus was going to Jerusalem”—understand this: he went there to preach, not to ride there proudly like many priests today. And I, to my shame, also ride, and in that I confess my own lack of steadfastness, that I do not go on foot to preach as my Redeemer went. I do not know whether it would help if I went on foot, since I could not come so far or so quickly.

“He went between Samaria”—the pagan land—“and Galilee”—the Jewish land. “And as he was entering a certain town,” they met him, coming out into the open field—“ten men with leprosy.”

B. Know this: they met him outside the town, and there the miracle happened.

First, this is striking because lepers did not live inside towns, for it was commanded in the Law. In Leviticus 13:46 and in Numbers 5:2 it is written: “Command the children of Israel that they put outside the camp everyone who has leprosy.” Second, the miracle took place openly outside the town so that it might lead many who stood at a distance to faith. They stood far off, first because the Law forbade them to come near, and perhaps also out of reverence for Jesus as they sought healing.

“They lifted up” their voices out of a great desire to be healed and to be heard, “saying: ‘Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!’”

Their cry is a prayer that is sweet, humble, spiritual, and shared together.

It is *sweet* because they say, “Jesus!” For, as Saint Bernard says, “Jesus” is a sweet song in the ear, honey in the mouth, and joy in the heart.

It is *humble* because they say, “Master,” confessing that he has the right to command them as his own.

It is *spiritual* because they do not ask for money, as lepers usually do, but ask for mercy: “Have mercy on us!”

It is *shared* because none of them asks only for himself, but all pray together for all, saying, “Have mercy on *us*!”

Such prayer Jesus gladly hears—sweet, humble, spiritual, and shared—and so he heard these men and healed them of leprosy.

First, he looked at them with compassion. The reading says: “When he saw them”—with bodily eyes—though from eternity he had already seen them by his divine knowledge—“he said, ‘Go, show yourselves to the priests.’”

Three things appear in Jesus here: gracious mercy in the way he looks at them, wisdom in the command he gives, and power in the healing that follows. For Jesus is good, wise, and mighty.

C. Now understand why Jesus told them to go and show themselves to the priests.

The *first reason* was to fulfill the old Law. In Leviticus 14:2 it is written that anyone cleansed from leprosy was to show himself to the priest. That was for two reasons. First, because the priests were to recognize leprosy and to discern who had truly been cleansed, so they could declare that such a person might re-enter the community. Second, so that the leper would offer the sacrifice that God had commanded.

Here today’s priests take this as a pretext to demand money for confession. But that will not help them. For Christ, the priest of the New Covenant, took nothing from the lepers when he healed them. And to his own priests of the New Covenant he said in Matthew 10:8: “You received freely, give freely.” You received without paying; for my sake give without asking for pay.

Christ commanded these men to show themselves to the priests to fulfill the old Law, which at that time had not yet come to an end *in figuris et in ceremoniis*—in its pictures and sacrificial ceremonies.

The *second reason* he sent them to the priests was so that the priests would tell the people that Jesus had healed the lepers, and that through this the people would turn to Jesus as to God who is powerful.

The *third reason* was that the priests themselves might learn from this deed to believe in Jesus, since he had healed them. And that the priests would then advise those men to go back to Jesus and give him thanks and praise. Whether those priests did this, I do not know, but it does not seem so to me, for they constantly insulted the works of Christ and those who loved to hear him.

The *fourth reason* he sent them to the priests was to show that in spiritual cleansing from sins, sinners ought to go to priests and receive from them counsel on how they are to repent properly of their sins. But in order to show, dear Savior that he himself is the one who alone truly cleanses the soul from sin, and that he can forgive sins without the priests and does forgive them, he healed these lepers on the way, before they ever reached the priests.

This deed is weighed and explained by the saints, especially by Saint Jerome. He says that just as the priests of the Old Covenant had authority only to discern who was leprous and who was not, but had no power to cleanse anyone from leprosy or to make a healthy person leprous, so the priests of the New Covenant have authority to discern between sin and sin, but they have no power to cleanse anyone’s soul from sin or to make someone who is pure in soul become impure. So teaches Saint Jerome. I have written much about this elsewhere.

Now, if we accept that Christ’s command, “Go, show yourselves to the priests,” is a picture of the confession that people ought to make before priests, then I understand his words this way: when Christ says to the lepers, “Go, show yourselves to the priests,” he is signifying that mortal sinners should go and show their sins to priests who know how to discern between sin and sin.

When he says, “Go,” he shows that the sinner should not delay in this showing of himself, and that he should not go unwillingly but freely and willingly show himself.

When he says, “Show yourselves,” he is teaching that the sinner should not hide his sins but reveal them.

And when he says, “to the priests,” he shows that priests have authority to hear sins and to give counsel how a person, by the power of Christ, may be cleansed from sin.

From this we learn that confession should be willing, without compulsion; it should be without delay; it should be open and not hidden; it should be made to a priest; and it should be a whole confession of one’s sins.

For when sinners cry out in their hearts to Jesus and go to show themselves to the priests, he himself by his power cleanses them in their souls from sin before they ever reach the priest.

Therefore Saint Augustine says: “Great is the goodness of God, that he forgives sins even at the very promise to confess.” He has not yet corrected with his mouth, and yet already God has heard in his heart. So he speaks about David’s words in Psalm 32:5: “I said, ‘I will confess my injustice against myself to the Lord,’ and you forgave the guilt of my sin.”

And now the reading continues: “And it happened that as they went, they were made clean.”

But those whose sins are forgiven by Christ fall into two groups.

One group magnifies the priesthood and says that without a priest’s absolution no one can be absolved. They are like those Jews healed from leprosy who did not return to Jesus to give him praise.

The second group rightly says and truly believes that a sinner can have forgiveness of sins from God even if no priest here ever pronounces absolution over him—as God did with many in the Old Covenant and in the New. He did this with the thief on the cross, and with that open sinner in Luke 18:13 who confessed to God saying, “God, be merciful to me, a sinner!” That God forgave him his sins is confirmed by Christ there, who says in Luke 18:14 that he “went down to his house justified.”

But there are few who give such honor to Christ’s power—few, just as only one of the lepers returned to Jesus with praise. And he was a Samaritan, that is, a pagan from Samaria, that pagan land.

The reading says: “One of them, when he saw that he was cleansed, turned back,” and so on. One out of ten who were healed! This shows how rare it is to find people who are truly grateful to Jesus, as Jesus himself later says.

“When he saw that he was cleansed from leprosy, he turned back, praising God with a loud voice.” That loud voice shows the greatness of his gratitude, his devotion, and his faith. Therefore he praised God, not the priests to whom he had shown himself.

“He fell on his face”—there he showed humility—“at Jesus’ feet”—there he acknowledged the kindness and goodness of Jesus—“giving him thanks,” that is, as to God. “And he was a Samaritan,” that is, a pagan from Samaria. Saint Luke adds this as if to imply that the others were Jews, who thought their healing came to them as if from the Law because they had shown themselves to the priests. But that Samaritan confessed that he had been healed by Christ.

“And Jesus answered and said, ‘Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine?’” One commentary says that he speaks about the ungrateful as though they were unknown to him, saying, “Where are they?” For just as the ungrateful person does not acknowledge God’s kindness, so God does not acknowledge him for salvation and for grace.

Then Christ says, “Has no one been found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?” See, the Savior publicly exposes the ingratitude of the others and praises this man for his gratitude. And he says to him: “Get up and go, for your faith has made you well.” “Faith”—which is the foundation of all virtues for salvation. “Your faith”—not someone else’s faith, not the priest’s faith. “Has made *you* well”—you who are humble and grateful. “Has made you well”—in body from leprosy and in soul from sin, by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

Saint Bede, commenting on this reading, says that lepers represent heretics, who are inwardly corrupted with various stains and must be separated from the people so that they do not corrupt others by their sin.

And because *simony*—that great heresy of buying and selling holy things—alas, has terribly corrupted priests, they ought to be separated so that they do not corrupt others: selling indulgences, confession, baptism, preaching, the celebration of the mass, funerals, holy oil, blessings, and also the consecration of churches and altars. And greater simoniacs still sell bishoprics and other church offices, and others buy them.

If such men, together with those who help them, were truly separated from the priestly office and from the fellowship of the church, then there would not be many priests left! And bishops and others would have to go to work in the fields so that they would not live off the priesthood until they had been cleansed by true repentance from this leprosy of Jesus’—from this leprosy of simony.
