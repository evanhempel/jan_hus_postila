# Twenty-First Sunday After Holy Trinity

Gospel: Saint John, chapter 4, verses 46–53

At that time there was a certain *little king*—a royal official—whose son was sick in Capernaum. When he heard that Jesus had come from the land of the Jews into Galilee, he went to him and begged him to come down and heal his son, for the boy was starting to die. Then Jesus said to him, “Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.” The little king said to him, “Lord, come down before my son dies.” Jesus said to him, “Go; your son is alive.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went on his way. And as he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was alive. Then he asked them the hour when he had begun to get better, and they said to him, “Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.” Then the father realized that this was the very hour when Jesus had said to him, “Your son is alive.” And he believed, he and his whole household.

Saint Gregory says this Gospel reading, in one way, does not need much explanation, because it shows clearly and directly what happened. But then Saint Gregory weighs the story more deeply and says this: that little king, whose son was healed, did not have a complete faith.

He believed that Christ could heal his son.  
But he did not believe Christ could do it without being there in the body.  
He did not yet believe that Jesus, in his divinity, was already present with his son.

This is how Saint Gregory reads it. And this agrees with other saints who say that this little king did not really believe, because Jesus said to him, “Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.”

Here Saint John Chrysostom says: with these words the Lord shows clearly that the man did not believe.

And again Saint Gregory says: in an important way the man did not believe, because he did not attribute full power to Christ’s divinity.

So we should bring the saints into agreement like this:  
When Saint John says, “he did not believe,” it means he did not believe fully.  
And when Saint Gregory or someone else says, “the little king believed,” that means he believed something, but not completely.

And from both sides it is true.

Jesus both rebuked him—because he did not have full faith—  
and he also heard his prayer—because he did believe that Jesus could heal his son.

And afterwards, together with all his household, he believed completely.

Saint Gregory weighs a second question: Why did Christ refuse to go to the little king’s son, even when the man begged him, but promised to go to the centurion’s servant, when the centurion did not even ask him to come?

Gregory answers like this: What is the reason, except that our pride must be struck down by this? We do not honor in people the humanity by which they are made like God; instead we honor their rank and wealth. For when we weigh what they *have*, we delay to consider what they *are*.

So our Redeemer, to show that the things which are high and honored among men are not what the saints value—but rather what they reject—was ready to go to the centurion’s servant.

Look—our pride is put to shame.

That is Saint Gregory’s teaching: by this, Christ humiliated our pride—he did not want to go to the son of the little king, although the king begged him, yet for the servant of a pagan centurion, a heathen soldier, he himself said he would come, though the man had not asked him to.

O bishops, priests, and monks—if only we would take this to heart!

We are, sadly, quick to go to the rich, and slow to go to the poor.  
If a rich man is sick, many hurry to him.  
If a poor man is sick, not even one will look in on him.

And I hear them grumbling: “Since we are not allowed to take the holy oil out, let them bring the sick to the church.”

Alas! They do not remember how Christ himself went to a servant when he was not asked, and also how he says of the Last Judgment in Matthew 25:41, 43: “I was sick, and you did not come to me; go, you cursed, into the eternal fire!”

So from this reading, following Saint Gregory, we learn that our merciful Savior corrected and taught this wandering little king. He showed mercy to him by healing his son. And especially, he called him, his son, and his whole household graciously to faith.

By doing this as true God and true man, he gave us an example that we should be humble.

Saint Gregory speaks to this and says: Let us not be proud, even if we do something good. Let no deed puff us up; let neither wealth nor rank lift us high, because when we swell with these things, we are hateful to God.

And further he says: “Remember this with your whole mind, dearest brothers: do not be born into a habit of honoring in your neighbors the wealth of this world. For God’s sake, honor this in people—even when they are not entrusted to your care—that they are made in the image of God.”

That is Gregory’s teaching.

He speaks so that we may be humble, boasting in nothing. We must not honor people because of their riches, or their noble birth, or their fine clothing, but because they are creatures made in the likeness of the Holy Trinity.

And truly, in this almost the whole world is wandering astray—that it values a rich, finely dressed person more highly than a humble poor one.

But God does not do this.  
God shows no partiality.  
That means: he does not value one person more because of wealth, or because of birth, or because of bodily beauty, than another who is poor, low-born, and poorly clothed—only if the one is more virtuous.

So it is virtue that makes a person precious before God. Whoever is more virtuous is better before God, more honored in his sight.

And so we too must value people that way. When at least by their deeds we can see that a poor person seems to be better than a rich one, we must not look at the money or the beautiful clothes.

Saint James the apostle teaches us this in his second chapter, verses 1–6. He says:

“My brothers, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ while you show favoritism to persons. Suppose a man comes into your meeting with a gold ring and wearing fine clothes, and a poor man in filthy clothes also comes in. If you pay special attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and you say, ‘You sit here in a good seat,’ and you say to the poor man, ‘You stand over there,’ or, ‘Sit here on the floor by my feet,’ have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? Listen, my dearest brothers: has not God chosen the poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him? And you do not honor the poor man.”

That is all from Saint James.

Alas for me! How many times I have broken this holy Scripture—getting up, or taking off my hood, or bowing to the rich man and not to the poor; sending the servant with a coin to buy a drink for the rich man, instead of putting that coin into the hand of the poor!

And yet, I trust in the merciful Jesus, our Redeemer, that he has forgiven me and that he will keep me from this in the future.

Now I return to the reading and will still say something about this little king.

Saint Augustine speaks about this Gospel like this: “This man who was asking—how did he believe? What do you expect to hear from me about him? Ask the Lord himself what he knows about him. For when the man begged him, Jesus answered, ‘Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.’”

Augustine says: Christ is rebuking a man whose faith is lukewarm, or cold, or who perhaps has no faith at all. He only wants to make a test, by the healing of his son, what Christ might be like, who he might be, and how great his power might be.

We have heard the man’s words as he begged, but we did not see his unbelieving heart. Yet the very one who said these words is the one who both heard the spoken words and looked inside the heart.

And the evangelist also gives testimony that the man still did not believe, he who begged the Lord to come into his house.

So says Saint Augustine, showing that the little king either at first did not believe in Christ at all, or did not believe fully.

It is also important that Christ says, “Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.”

And in the reading from Matthew 12:38–39, when the priests and scribes said to Jesus, “Teacher, we want to see a miracle from you from heaven,” he answered them, saying, “An evil and unfaithful generation asks for a miracle.”

With these words our dear Savior shows that those people are not believers who demand miracles in order to believe—unless perhaps a saint asks for a sign to confirm others, so that God may show his power, as the apostles did when they raised the dead.

But Christians must be on guard, especially in our time, not to let themselves be led astray by the miracles and wonders of false prophets, the messengers of Antichrist.

Our dear Savior warns us in Matthew 24:11: “False prophets”—that is, false preachers—“will arise, and they will give great signs and wonders, and they will mislead many.”

Therefore believers must be truly careful, so that they are not moved away from the truth of God’s law and from following our Lord Jesus Christ, who warns us, saying in Matthew 24:4: “Watch out, so that no one leads you astray!”

I also notice that the reading says, “There was a *little king*,” and it does not say, “There was a king.” This is to show that every king of this world is only a small *little king* compared with the great King, Christ, who is King of kings.

For the kingdom of this world, the realm of earthly kings, is small:  
First, because it is only a patch of earth.  
Second, because they have it only for a short time.  
Third, because they lose it whether they like it or not, and sooner than they expect.

Therefore Scripture says in *Ecclesiastes* 10:11: “All ruling is short—know this: every rule in this world is small.”

So people are foolish who work harder and desire more eagerly to gain a lordship or kingdom in this world than to gain the kingdom of heaven, about which the Savior says in Matthew 6:33: “Seek first the kingdom of heaven.”

---

Also know this: every one of God’s chosen ones, when he is in God’s grace—that is, when he is free from deadly sin—is a king.

First, because the kingdom of heaven belongs to him.  
Second, because he is a son of the highest King, and rightly says, Matthew 6:9: “Our Father who are in heaven.”  
Third, because he is free, for Christ the King says in John 8:36: “You will truly be free when the Son sets you free.”  
Fourth, because every chosen son of God, when he is in grace, is anointed with the gift of the Holy Spirit for the kingdom of heaven, as Saint John says in his first letter, chapter 2, verse 20: “You have an anointing from the Holy One”—that is, from the Spirit.

And as a sign of this, each of us is anointed in baptism, to show that we must fight for the kingdom of heaven against the devil. He lost that kingdom, and now he would gladly see that no human person ever receives it.

This Gospel can also be understood in a spiritual way.

The little king’s son can mean the desire of a person.  
Because of the sin of the first man, a human being is now called a *little king* and not “king” as God is King.

The little king’s son—that is, desire—is sick in Capernaum, which means “field of fatness” or “place of rich pasture.” There a person feeds himself on pleasures and is often sick, not only in the soul but also in the body.

For God says in Deuteronomy 32:15: “He grew fat and thick and wide and proud”—that is, he turned away from my command.

We do not even need to prove this word of God; we see it with our own eyes: the more people indulge in pleasure, the more often, in general, they are unhealthy in both body and soul.

So Solomon says in Proverbs: “The prosperity of fools will destroy them.”

And Christ says in Luke 6:24: “How terrible for you who are rich, who have your comfort here!”

Then the illness of the little king’s son, which was a fever, represents sin. Sin shakes a person, like pride, envy, and anger. These three sins not only shake God’s grace out of the soul, but they often shake the body as well, as we can clearly see in proud, envious, and angry people.

There are many other spiritual meanings in this reading. But because, for the sake of time, I always try first that people understand the plain words of the Gospel, I must leave those other spiritual senses aside.

And because this reading, in its wording as you have heard, is easy to understand, there is no need to explain it word by word.
