This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon on John 2:1-11 (the Wedding at Cana), focusing on Christ's first miracle and the theology of marriage. Hus connects the miracle to broader teachings about marital union as sacred.

### Key Points:
- **The Miracle at Cana**:
  - Jesus turns water into wine at a wedding, revealing His divine power (John 2:1-11).
  - Mary's intercession ("They have no wine") shows her compassion, though Jesus responds that His "hour has not yet come" (John 2:4).
  - The miracle strengthens the disciples' faith (John 2:11).

- **Theology of Marriage**:
  1. **Divine Institution**: Marriage was established by God in Eden (Genesis 2:22) for procreation and companionship.
  2. **Purposes**:
     - To avoid fornication (1 Corinthians 7:2).
     - To symbolize Christ's union with the Church (Ephesians 5:25-32).
  3. **Sacramental Nature**: Marriage mirrors Christ's sacrificial love for the Church (Ephesians 5:25).
  4. **Indissolubility**: Divorce is forbidden except for adultery (Matthew 19:6).

- **Practical Guidance**:
  - Marriage requires mutual consent, fidelity, and freedom from coercion.
  - Hus critiques corrupt practices (e.g., marriages for lust or wealth).

- **Moral Warnings**:
  - Lustful unions (like those of Sara’s seven husbands in Tobit 6-7) are condemned.
  - Spouses must love selflessly, as Christ loved the Church.

### Key Quote:
> "What God has joined together, let no one separate."  
> — *Matthew 19:6* (cited by Hus to emphasize marriage's sanctity).
