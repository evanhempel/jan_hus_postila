### Reading for the First Sunday in Advent

Saint Matthew writes in chapter 21, verses 1–9. When Jesus drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage (that village) at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two of his disciples (Peter and Philip), saying to them: Go into the little town (into Jerusalem) that is opposite you, and at once you will find a she-ass tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me. And if anyone says anything to you, say that their lord (the lord of the she‑ass and the colt) has need of them (that is: he needs them in order to fulfill the prophecy), and at once he will let them go. And all this happened so that what was spoken through the prophet [Isaiah in chapter 62, verse 11] might be fulfilled, who says: Say to the daughter of Zion (that is: to the people of Jerusalem), Behold, your king is coming to you, gentle, seated on a she‑ass, and on a colt, the foal of a beast subject (that is: of a she‑ass enslaved to labor). And the disciples went and did as Jesus had commanded them, and brought him the she‑ass and the colt; and they laid their garments on them (on the she‑ass and on the colt), and made him sit on them. And many in the crowd spread their garments on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. And the crowds who went before him and those who followed after cried out, saying: Hosanna (that is: Lord, save!) to the Son of David (that is: through the Son of David)! Blessed is he who has come in the name of God.

A. This reading in fact took place on Palm Sunday, and so it belongs more to that day for remembrance than to today. Yet we read it today remembering his coming, which the Christian congregation commemorates today, we Czechs calling it "Advent" from the Latin; for in Latin adventus in Czech is called příchod, that is, coming or visitation. And holy Church remembers this from today until the day of Christ’s birth; and so that whole span of time is now called Advent, that is: the time in which we remember Christ’s visitation.

Know then that Christ’s visitation is threefold, as Scripture shows. The first is in the flesh. By that he visited us when, being God, he was made flesh in the womb of the Virgin Mary. Of this he himself says in John 16:28: I went out from the Father and came into the world.

The second visitation of Christ is spiritual, by which he visits us with his grace; for he says in John 14:23: If anyone loves me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him. By this Christ means that he and the Father come to that person who loves Christ and keeps his words. And of this visitation he says in the Revelation of Saint John, chapter 3, verse 20: Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears my voice and opens the door to me, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with me. Christ stands at the door in that he is ready, by his grace, to visit the will of a person, and he knocks when he admonishes by an inward prompting, or by pain, fear, or sickness, or by giving various gifts. And whoever hears his voice, that is, his command, and opens the door to Christ by leaving sin and fully turning his will toward the good, to that person Christ comes in, visiting him with his grace; and if a person dies in that grace, not turning back to sin, then Christ will dine with him and he with Christ, that is, he will enjoy eternal joy. And so Christ visits a person spiritually whenever a person leaves mortal sins and he forgives them, and whenever he graces someone with some special favor, and whenever at death he comes to that person with his grace. And likewise he also visits evil people with terror, revenge, and eternal damnation, especially at their death. For Saint Matthew says in chapter 24, verse 42: Watch, for you do not know in what hour your Lord is coming. And in Revelation 3:3 he says: Therefore, if you will not watch, I will come like a thief, and you will not know in what hour I will come to you.

The third visitation of Christ is yet to come, on the Day of Judgment, of which he himself says in Matthew 25:31–32: When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all his angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his kingdom, and all peoples will be gathered before him. Of this coming we also confess in the Creed that he will come to judge the living and the dead.

From this you further learn that the first visitation happened once for all, in that he was incarnate only once; the second happens every day, in that every day he visits the faithful with his grace, and the wicked with vengeance or admonition; the third is to happen once for all. For the first visitation we ought to be very thankful, and to remember it with love. For the second we ought to be diligent, that he may be pleased to dwell with us, and that he may visit us with special grace on the day of his birth; for this we ought to conduct ourselves devoutly. For the third we ought to watch very carefully, for he strictly commands us to watch very carefully, that is, to guard ourselves from sin and to grow in God’s grace. And for these three visitations holy Church has ordained that from today we should more earnestly than before strengthen ourselves in virtues, remembering that he came in the flesh for our salvation, that with his grace he will visit us especially on the day of his birth, and that thirdly on the Day of Judgment he will come and give us the eternal kingdom.

B. And for this visitation there is a threefold preparation. First, that the faithful, while waiting for their Lord, should conduct themselves honorably, and especially when he draws near. This rests on the word of Saint Isaiah in chapter 1, verses 16–17: Cease to do evil, learn to do good. And as David says in Psalm 34:15 and Psalm 37:27: Turn away from evil and do good. The second preparation is that, when we hear that so great a Lord is near, we should make ourselves ready in a threefold way. First, by preparing him a house, that is, by cleansing our soul for him from sins; for he says through Isaiah in chapter 1, verse 16: Wash yourselves and be clean, put away the evil of your thoughts from before my eyes! Second, we must prepare ourselves with beautiful clothing, as Isaiah says in chapter 52, verse 1: Clothe yourself with your garments of glory, O Jerusalem, holy city! Jerusalem in this place means the assembly of the faithful, which is the holy city in which King Christ is to dwell forever; and this city is to clothe itself with garments of glory, that is, with virtues which make a person glorious. And such clothing is incomparably better for every soul than all the garments of this world with which the body is clothed; indeed, a single virtue clothes a person better than any bodily garment. And this garment is to be white, that is, unstained by sin.

C. Third, we must prepare ourselves to give fitting food to so great a Lord. The fitting food by which Christ is fed is the fulfilling of his will, as he himself says in John 4:34: My food is to do the will of him who sent me, that I may finish his work. And again he says, John 6:27: Prepare food not that which perishes, but that which remains unto eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. They prepare for themselves food that does not perish, who fulfill the will of God and remain in it, for forever they will enjoy the joy of the Godhead. And thus true Christians feed Christ every day when they fulfill his commandments. And he himself will acknowledge this on the Day of Judgment, when he will say to the righteous, Matthew 25:35: I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me drink.

So we ought to prepare ourselves in this way: to remember worthily his first holy visitation, to ready ourselves for the second and for the third, and so to receive his holy body worthily at Christmas. For Saint Augustine says in a sermon: Most beloved brothers! By God’s grace the days have now come to us in which we desire to keep the feast of God’s birth; therefore I ask and admonish that we work as best we can, so that on that day with a clean conscience, with great diligence, with a pure heart and body we may be able to approach God’s altar, and be found worthy to receive his body and his blood, not for judgment, but for the healing and salvation of the soul. For in Christ’s body our life consists, as he himself says, John 6:53: Unless you eat the body of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in yourselves. Therefore, let the one who wants to receive life change his life; for if he does not change his life, he will receive life unto judgment and will be more damaged by it than revived. Oh, how blessed is that soul which by God’s help has so ordered its life that it is worthy to receive Christ as a guest! Likewise, how unblessed and sorrowful is that conscience which has so defiled itself by evil deeds that Christ does not choose to dwell in it, but the devil begins to reign there! All this Saint Augustine says.

From this whole discourse, as Saint Paul also commands in today’s Epistle, let us take instruction, Romans 13:12: Let us cast off the works of darkness, that is, let us put away sins that lead to eternal darkness, and let us put on the armor of light, that is, let us receive virtues that lead us to eternal light. For living in this way, we will rightly remember Christ’s threefold visitation: we will be worthy that he now visit us with special grace, then at our death, and finally on the Day of Judgment. He has already visited us by his incarnation; let us remember that this visitation has already taken place. He has visited us with his grace at baptism, in that he took away our sins; and if we have sinned after baptism, yet he has visited us with grace in repentance; and if there are some who have not sinned mortally after baptism, still he has visited them with special grace and is visiting them. And we await the third visitation, on the Day of Judgment; and as we await it, we must always be ready, for he himself says in Luke 12:40 and Matthew 25:13: Be ready, for in the hour you do not think, the Son of Man is coming. And we must be so ready that we gladly endure, for the sake of our beloved Christ, whatever befalls us, just as he, for us sinners, though he owed us nothing, for his enemies’ sake willingly endured a cruel death; and it was to that death that he willingly came to Jerusalem, and rode on a colt with great weeping, showing to the people of Jerusalem a gracious visitation.

Therefore this reading is read today about the spiritual visitation by which he visited the faithful through his holy suffering: not to seize their possessions, nor to cut off their heads, but to redeem them from death and to give them the eternal kingdom. Therefore the holy prophet Zechariah prophesies, Zechariah 9:9, and says to holy Church: Behold, your king has come to you, righteous and a savior, he poor and riding on a she‑ass and on a colt. In this word the prophet comforts holy Church, saying: Behold, your king— a king gracious in vengeance, mighty in defense, wise in governance, rich in reward. He says: your, because he created you; your, because he sustains you; your, because he defends you from the devil; your, because he redeemed you by his death; your, because he loved you unto death; your, because he will give you the eternal kingdom, if in the end you will be thankful. Therefore he says: Behold, your king has come, or has ridden, to you, righteous, who will give to each according to his merit; a savior, for he has come to save, as he himself says, John 3:16–17: So has God loved the world that he gave his only‑begotten Son, that everyone who believes in him should not perish but have eternal life; for God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through him.

Now you have his own testimony that he has been sent by the Father into this world not to judge the world, but to save the world, that is, the people chosen for salvation from out of the world; for he will not judge them to eternal damnation. Therefore the prophet says to holy Church: Behold, your king goes to you, righteous and a savior! and he poor, that he might enrich you by his poverty, as Saint Paul says, 2 Corinthians 8:9: Christ became poor for us, that we might be enriched by his poverty — that is, now in virtues, and afterward in heavenly joy. For this reason he came poor, riding on a colt, as the reading bears witness, which I do not wish to explain now; for it seems better to me to reserve it for Palm Sunday, for it took place at that time, and also that I may not detain you any longer.

Therefore, dearest ones, let this be enough for you now, and prepare yourselves for the second and the last visitation, grieving over your sins, growing in virtues, doing penance, and earnestly desiring his visitation.
