### Reading for the First Sunday in Advent  

It is written by Saint Matthew in chapter 21, verses 1–9:

When Jesus drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage (that village) at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two of his disciples (Peter and Philip), saying to them:  

“Go into the little town (into Jerusalem) that is opposite you (that is, in front of you), and right away you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me. And if anyone says anything to you, say that their lord (the lord of the donkey and the colt) has need of them (that is, he needs them, in order to fulfill the prophecy), and right away he will let them go.”  

And all this took place so that what was spoken through the prophet (Isaiah in chapter 62, verse 11) might be fulfilled, who says:  

“Say to the daughter of Zion (that is, to the people of Jerusalem): Look, your king is coming to you, gentle, sitting on a donkey and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden (that is, of a she‑donkey subjected to work).”  

And when the disciples had gone, they did as Jesus had commanded them, and they brought him the donkey and the colt. And they laid their garments on them (on the donkey and on the colt), and he had them seat him on them.  

And many in the crowd spread their garments on the road, and others cut (that is, chopped) branches from the trees and spread them on the road. And the crowds who went ahead of him and those who followed after him cried out, saying:  

“Osanna (that is, ‘Lord, save’) to the son of David (that is, through the son of David)! Blessed is he who has come in the name of God.”

A. This reading in fact took place on Palm Sunday, and therefore it belongs more to the remembrance of that day than to today. Yet we read it today, remembering his coming, which the Christian congregation today remembers, when Czechs say “Advent” according to the Latin tongue; for in Latin *adventus* is called in Czech “příchod” or “navštívení” (coming or visitation).  

And Holy Church remembers this from today until the day of Christ’s birth; and so that whole period is now called “Advent,” that is, the time in which Christ’s visitation is remembered.

Here know that Christ’s visitation is threefold, as Scripture shows.

The first is in the flesh. In this way he visited us when, being God, he became incarnate in the womb of the Virgin Mary. Of this he himself says in John 16:28:  

“I came out from the Father and I came into the world.”

The second visitation of Christ is spiritual, by which he visits us with his grace. For he says, John 14:23:  

“If anyone loves me, he keeps my words; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him.”  

By this Christ means that he and the Father come to that person who loves Christ and keeps his words. And of this visitation he says in the Revelation of Saint John, chapter 3, verse 20:  

“Look, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears my voice and opens the door for me, I will go in to him and will eat the evening meal with him, and he with me.”  

Christ stands at the door in that he is ready, by his grace, to visit the will of a person; and he knocks when he admonishes by inspiration, by suffering, by fear or sickness, or by giving various gifts.  

And whoever hears the sound of his command and opens the door to Christ, leaving sin and turning his will fully to the good, to that person Christ will go in, visiting him with his grace. And if a person finishes his life in that grace, not turning back to sin, then Christ will eat the evening meal with him and he with Christ—that is, he will enjoy eternal joy.  

And so Christ visits a person spiritually whenever a person leaves mortal sins and he forgives them, and whenever he graces that person with some special grace, and when at death he comes to him with his grace.  

And likewise he also visits evil people with fear, vengeance, and eternal damnation, especially at death. For Saint Matthew says in chapter 24, verse 42:  

“Keep watch, for you do not know in which hour your Lord will come.”  

And in the Revelation of Saint John 3:3 he says:  

“Therefore, if you will not keep watch, I will come like a thief, and you will not know in which hour I will come to you.”

The third visitation of Christ is still to come, on the Day of Judgment, of which he himself says in Matthew 25:31–32:  

“When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all his angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his kingdom, and all peoples will be gathered before him.”  

Of this coming we also confess in the Creed that he will come to judge the living and the dead.

From this you further have that the first visitation took place once, since he was incarnate only once; the second takes place every day, since every day he visits the faithful with his grace, and the wicked with vengeance or admonition; the third is to take place only once.

For the first visitation we must be very grateful, and remember it lovingly. For the second we must be diligent, so that he may deign to dwell with us, and so that he may visit us with special grace on the day of his birth; in this we must conduct ourselves devoutly. For the third we must keep very careful watch, for he commands us very earnestly to keep watch—that is, to guard ourselves from sin and to grow in God’s grace.  

And for these three visitations Holy Church has established that from today we should equip ourselves in virtues more diligently than before, remembering that by his incarnation he came for our salvation, that with his grace he will especially visit us on the day of his birth, and that the third time, when he comes on the Day of Judgment, he will give us the eternal kingdom.

B. And for this visitation there is a threefold preparation.

First, that the faithful, while they are waiting for their Lord, should conduct themselves honorably, and especially when he is drawing near. And this rests on the word of Isaiah in chapter 1, verses 16–17:  

“Stop doing evil; learn to do good.”  

And as David says, Psalm 34:15 and 37:27:  

“Turn away from evil and do good.”

The second preparation is that, when we hear that such a great Lord is near, we should prepare ourselves in three ways.

First, by preparing for him a house—that is, by cleansing for him our soul from sins. For he says through Isaiah in chapter 1, verse 16:  

“Wash yourselves and be clean; cast away the evil of your thoughts from before my eyes!”

Second, we must prepare ourselves with beautiful clothing, as Isaiah says in 52:1:  

“Clothe yourself with the garment of your glory, O Jerusalem, holy city!”  

Jerusalem in this place means the congregation of the faithful, which is the holy city in which King Christ is to dwell forever. And that city must clothe itself in the garment of glory—that is, in virtues, which make a person glorious. And that garment is immeasurably better for every soul than all the garments of this world with which the body is clothed; indeed, one single virtue clothes a person better than any bodily garment. And that garment must be white—that is, not defiled by sin.

C. Third, we must prepare ourselves so that we may give fitting food to such a great Lord. The fitting food by which Christ is fed is the fulfillment of his will, as he himself says in John 4:34:  

“My food is that I do the will of him who sent me, and that I finish his work.”  

And again he says, John 6:27:  

“Prepare food not that which perishes, but that which remains unto eternal life, which food the Son of Man will give you.”  

Those prepare for themselves the food that does not perish, who fulfill the will of God and remain in it; for they will forever enjoy the joy of the Godhead.  

And thus truly Christian people feed Christ every day when they fulfill his commandments. And he himself will acknowledge this on the Day of Judgment when he says to the righteous, Matthew 25:35:  

“I was hungry and you fed me; I was thirsty and you gave me drink.”

See, this is how we must prepare ourselves: that we may rightly remember his first holy visitation, prepare ourselves for the second and for the third, and thus worthily receive his holy body at Christmas.

For Saint Augustine says in a sermon:  

“Most beloved brothers! By the grace of God days have now come to us in which we desire to celebrate the birth of God. Therefore I ask and admonish that we labor, as best we can, so that on that day, with a clean conscience, with great diligence, with a pure heart and body, we may be able to draw near to the altar of God, and that we may be found worthy to receive his body and his blood not for judgment, but for the healing and the salvation of the soul.  

For in the body of Christ our life depends, as he himself says, John 6:53: ‘If you will not eat the body of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in yourselves.’ Therefore, let whoever wants to receive life change his life; for if he does not change his life, he will take life to his judgment, and will be more corrupted by it than revived.  

Oh, how blessed is that soul which, by God’s help, has ordered its life in such a way that it is worthy to receive Christ as a guest! And likewise, how unblessed and miserable is that conscience which has so defiled itself by evil deeds that Christ does not deign to dwell in it, but the devil begins to rule there!”  

All this says Saint Augustine.

From all this teaching, as also Saint Paul in today’s Epistle commands, let us take instruction. Romans 13:12:  

“Let us cast off the works of darkness”—that is, let us put away sins that lead to eternal darkness—“and let us put on the armor of light”—that is, let us receive virtues that lead us to eternal light.  

For living in this way, we will rightly remember Christ’s threefold visitation: we will be worthy that he now visit us with special grace, then at death, and finally on the Day of Judgment.  

He has already visited us by his incarnation; let us remember that that visitation has already taken place. He has thus visited us with his grace at baptism, by which he freed us from sins. And even if we have sinned after baptism, he has visited us with grace in repentance. And if there are some who have not sinned mortally after baptism, yet he has visited them and is visiting them with special grace.  

And we are awaiting the third visitation on the Day of Judgment. And as we wait for it, we must always be ready, for he himself says, Luke 12:40 and Matthew 25:13:  

“Be ready, for in the hour you do not think, the Son of Man will come.”  

And we must be so ready that we gladly endure, for dear Christ’s sake, whatever may befall us, just as he, for us sinners, though he owed us nothing, for his enemies’ sake, gladly suffered a cruel death—to which death he willingly came up to Jerusalem, and rode in on a donkey with great weeping, showing to the people of Jerusalem a gracious visitation.

Therefore this reading is read today about the spiritual visitation by which he has visited the faithful through his holy suffering—not to seize their goods from them, nor to take their lives, but to redeem them from death and to give them the eternal kingdom.  

Therefore the holy prophet Zechariah prophesies, Zechariah 9:9, and says to Holy Church:  

“Look, your king has come to you, righteous and a savior; he is poor, sitting on a donkey and on a colt.”  

In this word the prophet comforts Holy Church, saying:  

“Look, your king”—a king gracious in vengeance, mighty in protection, wise in rule, rich in reward.  

He says “your” because he created you; “your” because he sustains you; “your” because he defends you from the devil; “your” because he redeemed you by his death; “your” because he loved you unto death; “your” because he will give you the eternal kingdom, if finally you will be grateful.  

Therefore he says: “Look, your king has come to you,” or, “has ridden to you, righteous,” who will give to each according to his merit; “a savior,” for he has come to save, as he himself says, John 3:16–17:  

“God has so loved the world that he gave his only‑begotten Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through him.”

See, now you have his testimony that he was sent by the Father into this world not to judge the world, but to save the world—that is, the people chosen for salvation out of the world; for he will not judge these to eternal damnation.  

Therefore the prophet says to Holy Church: “Look, your king comes to you, righteous and a savior, and he is poor,” so that by his poverty he may make you rich, as Saint Paul says, 2 Corinthians 8:9:  

“Christ for us was made poor, so that we might be made rich by his poverty”—that is, now in virtues and afterward in the joy of heaven.  

For this reason he came poor “on a donkey,” as the reading bears witness, which I do not wish to explain now; for it seems better to keep it for Palm Sunday, since it took place at that time, and also so that I may not speak too long.

Therefore, dearest ones, let this be enough for you, and prepare yourselves for the second and last visitation: by grieving over sins, by advancing in virtues, by fulfilling repentance, and by earnestly desiring his visitation.
