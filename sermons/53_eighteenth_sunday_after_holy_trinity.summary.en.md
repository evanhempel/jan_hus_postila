title: Eighteenth Sunday After Holy Trinity
---

This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon for the Eighteenth Sunday after Holy Trinity, based on Matthew 22:35-46. The sermon focuses on the greatest commandment—loving God and neighbor—and Christ's wisdom in answering the Pharisees' test.

### Key Content:
- **Context**: The Pharisees and Sadducees unite to test Jesus with three questions, including which commandment is greatest.
- **Greatest Commandment**: Jesus answers with Deuteronomy 6:5—loving God with all one's heart, soul, and mind—calling it the "first and greatest commandment."
  - This commandment encompasses all others, as true love for God prevents idolatry, misuse of His name, and neglect of Sabbath.
- **Second Commandment**: Loving one's neighbor as oneself (Leviticus 19:18) is "similar" to the first, as it reflects love for God's image in humanity.
  - Proper love prioritizes spiritual good over worldly attachments.
- **Christ's Divinity**: Jesus proves His divinity by citing Psalm 110:1, where David calls the Messiah "Lord," silencing His opponents.
- **Practical Application**:
  1. Love God above all, aligning one's will with His.
  2. Love neighbors rightly—prioritizing their souls and virtue over kinship or worldly gain.
  3. All commandments "hang" on these two, fulfilling the Law and Prophets (Matthew 22:40).

### Key Quote:
> "Milovati budeš pána boha svého ze všeho srdce svého, a ze všie duše své, i ze všie mysli své. To jest najvěččie a prvé přikázanie."  
> *(Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind. This is the first and greatest commandment.)*
