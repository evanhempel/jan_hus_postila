This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon on John 10:1-10, where he expounds on Christ as the true shepherd and door to salvation, contrasting Him with false leaders who enter by other means.

### Key Points:
1. **Christ as the Door and Shepherd**  
   - Jesus is the only true entrance to salvation ("I am the door of the sheep").  
   - Those who enter by Him are saved; all others are "thieves and robbers."  

2. **False Shepherds (Thieves and Robbers)**  
   - Leaders who seek power, wealth, or status without Christ’s humility are thieves:  
     - They steal God’s glory and exploit the flock.  
     - They destroy souls through greed and hypocrisy.  
   - Jan Hus condemns corrupt clergy who hoard church resources meant for the poor.  

3. **The Marks of Christ’s Sheep**  
   - They hear and obey Christ’s voice (truth).  
   - They follow Him in humility and virtue.  
   - They reject false teachers ("they flee from strangers").  

4. **Warnings to Corrupt Leaders**  
   - Citing Church Fathers (Augustine, Bernard, Jerome), Hus warns:  
     - Unrepentant thieves face eternal damnation.  
     - Clergy must serve selflessly, not for personal gain.  

5. **Salvation Through Christ Alone**  
   - Only through Christ can one find grace, leave sin, and attain eternal life.  

### Key Quote:
> "I am the door; if anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly."  
> — *John 10:9-10*
