title: Reading for the First Sunday in Advent  
---

This is a summary of Jan Hus' sermon focusing on the First Sunday in Advent, which reflects on Christ's visitation and the importance of spiritual preparation.

- **Threefold Visitation of Christ**:
  1. **Physical Incarnation**: Christ came in human form through the Virgin Mary.
  2. **Spiritual Grace**: Christ visits believers through His grace and mercy.
  3. **Future Judgment**: Christ will return on Judgment Day.
  
- **Preparation for Christ’s Visitation**:
  1. **Repentance and Good Works**: Turn away from sin and practice righteousness.
  2. **Spiritual Cleansing**: Cleanse the soul from sin and clothe it in virtue.
  3. **Fulfilling God’s Will**: Serve Christ by doing His will, which is the true "food" that sustains eternal life.

- **Advent Reflection**:
  - Advent is a time to remember Christ’s first coming, prepare for His spiritual presence, and anticipate His final return.
  - Believers are called to live virtuously, repent, and remain vigilant.

**Key Quote**:
> "Aj král tvój přišel jest tobě spravedlivý a spasitel, on chudý sedě na oslici a na oslátku." (Behold, your King has come to you, righteous and a Savior, humble and riding on a donkey.)
```
