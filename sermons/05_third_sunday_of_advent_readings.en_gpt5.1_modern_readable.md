# Reading for the Third Sunday in Advent

### Gospel: Matthew 11:2–10

At that time, when John heard in prison about the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples to Jesus and said to Him: “Are You the One who is to come [who is to redeem], or should we expect someone else?” Jesus answered them: “Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind are receiving sight [being healed], the lame are walking, lepers are being cleansed, the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised, the poor are being helped by the word of God [*evangelisantur*, that is: they hear God’s word and are helped by it]. And blessed is the one who does not stumble [through unbelief] because of Me.”

When they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? (That is, not a man tossed about by pride or instability.) But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothes? [Yet he walks in rough clothing.] Look, those who wear soft clothes live in kings’ houses [living in pride and luxury]. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written [the prophet Malachi writes, 3:1]: ‘Look, I am sending My *angelus* (that is, My messenger) before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.’”

In this reading we hear, first, about the imprisonment of Saint John, the baptizer of Christ; second, about the wondrous works of our Lord Jesus Christ; and third,  
**A.** about the praise of Saint John.

The reading says about his imprisonment: “When John, who was in chains, heard about the works of Christ…” Know this: Saint John was in chains, in prison, because he rebuked King Herod for adultery, as Matthew writes in chapter 14, verses 3–4: “Herod seized John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother’s wife; for John had been saying to him, ‘It is not lawful for you to have her.’”

And Saint Mark says in chapter 6, verse 20: “Herod was afraid of John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he listened to him, he was greatly troubled, and yet he liked to listen to him.”

Why was that? Saint John Chrysostom explains in a sermon on Saint John: “John the Baptist spoke what belonged to the Law, what belonged to righteousness, what belonged to salvation; truly, he spoke what did not lead to hatred, but to love.” Again he says: “John warned Herod with holy admonitions, not with accusations. As a lover of purity, he wanted Herod to be saved, not condemned.”

But because it is very hard for anyone to abandon sexual sin, Herod did not want to leave his adultery and cast off his adulterous mistress. So he chained John and threw him into prison. And when John was in chains and heard about the works of Christ, he sent his disciples to Him. Therefore the reading says: “When John, who was in chains, heard about the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples and said to Him: ‘Are You the One who is to come, or should we expect someone else?’”

Know this: Saint John was not doubting whether Christ was the One who had come to take away the sins of the world. For earlier he had already confessed, saying in John 1:29: “See, the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world!” He had recognized Him while still in his mother’s womb and rejoiced; and when he baptized Him, he heard the Father in heaven testify that this was His beloved Son, whom we must listen to.

So why did John ask? He asked because he cared for his disciples and for other people. He wanted them not to doubt Christ, but to believe in Him, to listen to Him, and finally to follow Him. So he instructed his disciples to question Christ, saying in effect: “Are You the One who is to come as the promised Redeemer, or should we look for another?”

The reading continues: “Jesus answered them: ‘Go and tell John what you hear and see.’” As Luke writes in chapter 7, verse 21, at that very time He healed many people of diseases, sufferings, and evil spirits, and He gave sight to many who were blind. Then He said: “Go and tell John what you have heard from My preaching and what you have seen in My wondrous works.”

Here Saint Ambrose says: “The Lord preferred to answer by His deeds rather than by His words.” And Saint Jerome says: “Let words be silent; let deeds speak.”

So our gracious Savior was not really instructing John, but John’s disciples, so that they would believe that He truly was the One they had been waiting for—the One who had come to take away sins and free them from condemnation. And to show them that He is that One, after healing many people He said, “The blind receive sight,” and so on.

**B.** Understand that by “the blind” He also means those who sin out of ignorance; by “the lame,” those who live partly badly and partly well; by “lepers,” those who sin from strong, burning desire; by “the deaf,” those who are hardened in evil; and by “the dead,” those who sin from long, fixed habit.

All these people, even now, can be healed by the grace of our Savior—and many already are healed. Those who sinned in ignorance now “see”: they recognize what sin is and how sin had kept them blind. Those who were “lame,” sometimes living well and sometimes badly, are now living steadily in what is good. Those “lepers,” defiled by sin through desire, are now cleansed. Those who were “deaf,” careless and cold toward the word of God, now gladly listen to it. And those who were “dead”—that is, who had died in their soul through deadly sin and practiced sin as their settled habit—these are now rising out of that habit.

In these five spiritual healings there is a greater miracle than in bodily healings, and a greater work of God’s grace than in those physical wonders.

Then our dear Savior adds a sixth wonder, saying: “The poor are being helped by the word of God”—in Latin: *evangelisantur*, that is, they take in the reading which is the word of God, and in this way benefit both themselves and others: they hear it for themselves and then teach others. By “the poor,” understand the poor in spirit, the humble. These are the ones who are being helped by God’s word.

**C.** Know this: through the preaching of God’s word, the mind is enlightened; desire is straightened; evil desire is quenched; hardness in evil is broken; sin is driven away; and the grace of God begins to grow in a person.

From this you should understand: if someone hears the word of God but, out of these six blessings, feels none of them at work in himself, that is a sign that he is hearing the word of God to no profit.

About these poor in spirit—those to whom the Savior is sent to preach—He Himself says through Isaiah, in Isaiah 61:1–2 (and Luke 4:18–19): “He has sent Me to proclaim good news to the humble, to heal the brokenhearted, to announce freedom to prisoners, and opening of the prison to those who are bound, and to proclaim the Lord’s year of favor.”

**D.** Then, in the reading, the Savior says: “And blessed is the one who does not stumble because of Me!”

Understand that people stumble over Christ in many ways.

Some stumble over His mercy. They say He does not punish when He should punish, or that He punishes when He should not punish. About the first they complain, like Habakkuk in chapter 1, verse 13: “Why do You look on those who do evil?” That is, “Why do You not avenge it?” About the second, that lazy servant in Matthew 25:24 said: “I knew that You are a harsh man.”

Some stumble over His wisdom, thinking that He does some things that He should not do. Like those who curse the weather, or those who imagine that they themselves could have ordered things better than God has. Such people are surprised that things go well for the wicked, and they repeat Jeremiah’s words from chapter 15: “Why is the way of the wicked successful?” That is: “Why do things go according to their will?”

Some stumble because they are unwilling to suffer with Him, as His own disciples stumbled, of whom He said in Matthew 26:31: “All of you will fall away because of Me.”

Some stumble over His poverty, as priests commonly do when they refuse to be willingly poor. So that young man was offended, who went away from Christ in sorrow when He said to him in Matthew 19:21: “Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and then come, follow Me.”

Some stumble at His words, saying with the Jews in John 6:60: “This is a hard teaching; who can listen to it?” All who do not keep His commandments stumble at Him, imagining they are too heavy. And in general, everyone who does not believe in Him and does not obey what He has commanded is offended by Christ.

Therefore blessed is the one who does not finally stumble over Him. For although many have stumbled, yet afterward, returning again, by His grace they have been corrected.

**E.** Next the reading says: “When they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: ‘What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?’” As if He were saying: “Do you imagine John is like a reed, empty inside, without the grace of God? Do you suppose flattery shook him, since he sent to Me? Or instability, since he first bore witness to Me, saying in John 1:29: ‘See, the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world,’ and now says, ‘Are You the One who is to come, or should we expect another?’ Know that he has not moved from his testimony, as a reed is moved by the wind.”

On this Saint Gregory speaks like this: “As soon as the wind touches a reed, it bends it to the side. And what is signified by the reed except fleshly desire? As soon as the breeze of favor or of insult touches it, it is immediately bent. If the little wind of favor blows, it rejoices, boasts, and turns itself completely toward favor. But if the wind of insult blows from the same place where the wind of praise had come, it immediately turns to anger.”

But John was not a reed shaken by the wind. Neither the favor of praise made him a flatterer, nor anyone’s anger made him cruel. Earthly success did not lift him up in pride, and adversity did not cast him down from virtue. So he was not a reed shaken by the wind; no changeable thing was able to move him away from uprightness.

Therefore, dearest ones, let us learn not to be reeds shaken by the wind. Let us make firm our intention, which stands in the midst of the winds of people’s tongues. Let the state of our mind stand unmoved: let no insult stir us to anger; let no unstable favor bend us toward empty approval; let no trials, like poverty or other troubles, push us into impatience. Let us hold so steady that we, who are set in the constancy of faith, are not moved by the inconstancies of this world.

That is Saint Gregory’s teaching. In short: do not let yourself be moved by flattery into pride, nor by insults into anger, nor by prosperity into the sins of pride or luxury, nor by troubles—such as poverty or anything else—into impatience. If you stand firm like this, you will not be a reed shaken by the wind, and you will be worthy to be praised by Christ as He praised Saint John.

**F.** Christ goes on: “But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing?” As if He were saying: “John is no flatterer. If he had wanted to flatter, he would not have lived in the wilderness, nor would he now be sitting in rough clothing in Herod’s prison. If he had wanted to flatter, he would have flattered kings, not Me, who am poor. For those who want to walk in soft and beautiful clothes are found in kings’ houses—and they flatter.”

How many flatterers there are—especially priests—at the courts of dukes, kings, and nobles, and above all at the papal court! The greatest flatterers press their way there. They bow, they prostrate themselves to him more than to the Lord God. And they do all this so that they may wear soft and costly garments, and feed their pride, their pleasure, and their greed. Surely those people have wandered far from the life of John!

And what misery awaits us, who do not want to suffer, who live easily and still want to be saved! Woe to those who wear proud clothing for display, who have it cut in strange fashions, who own so many clothes that moths use as much of them—or more—than they do!

Saint James the apostle severely rebukes such people in chapter 5, verses 1–3: “Now listen, you rich people: weep and wail over the miseries that are coming upon you! Your wealth has rotted, and your clothes are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver are corroded; their corrosion will testify against you and will eat your flesh like fire.”

Wise people remember this and do not pile up expensive clothing. They use garments only so far as is needed to cover shame, drive away the cold, and provide what the body truly needs. For these are the reasons God gave clothing to Adam and Eve after they sinned. He gave them a woven garment so that they could cover their shame, and a coat of skins so that they could protect themselves from the cold.

Look at John: he had a rough garment of hair, with which he turned away both shame and cold. Therefore the Savior praises him, that he did not walk in soft clothing.

The reading continues: “But what did you go out to see? A prophet?” As if He were saying: “John is not silent out of envy, as if he wanted to be called a prophet greater than I.” Therefore Christ adds: “Yes, I tell you, and he is greater than a prophet. For this is he of whom it is written: ‘Look, I am sending My *angelus* before Your face.’”

These are the words of God the Father to the Son. God the Father sent John ahead of Christ His Son so that John would first preach, first baptize, and first die because of his preaching. In this way he prepared the way for the people, so that they might recognize Christ and believe in Him.

So John said to the priests from Jerusalem in John 1:26–27: “I baptize with water, but among you stands One you do not know. He is the One who comes after me, who existed before me, and I am not worthy to untie the strap of His sandal.”

Thus John was sent by God to go before Christ in His humanity: to preach first, to baptize first, and first to prepare the way for the people. And this way is the way of Christ, on which He came after John—to baptize us, to free us from our sins, and finally, if we live as good people, to give us by His grace eternal life.
