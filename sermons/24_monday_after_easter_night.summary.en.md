This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon on Luke 24:13-35, focusing on Christ's post-resurrection appearance to two disciples on the road to Emmaus. The sermon emphasizes themes of faith, hospitality, and scriptural understanding.

### Key Points:
1. **Christ's Appearance**  
   - Jesus joins two grieving disciples but prevents them from recognizing Him initially.
   - He rebukes their doubt ("O foolish and slow of heart to believe") and explains Scripture about His suffering and glory.

2. **Hospitality as Worship**  
   - The disciples urge the unrecognized Jesus to stay, illustrating the duty to welcome strangers (Hebrews 13:2).  
   - Christ reveals Himself in the breaking of bread, linking Eucharist to divine recognition.

3. **Resurrection Truths**  
   - Christ rose "truly" (not temporarily like Lazarus) to model spiritual resurrection from sin.  
   - His appearances (10 total post-resurrection) aimed to comfort, teach, and confirm faith.

4. **Practical Faith**  
   - Hearing Scripture alone isn’t enough; obedience brings enlightenment (Romans 2:13).  
   - Doubters are corrected, while those who discuss Christ’s sacrifice attract His presence.

### Key Quote:
> "Whoever wants to understand what they hear must hasten to fulfill what they’ve understood. For the Lord is not recognized when He speaks, but He deigns to be known when He is fed."  
> *(Paraphrasing Hus’s emphasis on Luke 24:30-31 and action-based faith)*
