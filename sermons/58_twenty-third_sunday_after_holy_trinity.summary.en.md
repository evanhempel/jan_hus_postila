title: Twenty-Third Sunday After Holy Trinity
---

Here is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon based on Matthew chapter 22, verses 15-21, delivered for the Twenty-Third Sunday after Holy Trinity. This sermon focuses on the Pharisees' hypocrisy and Jesus' wisdom in navigating their trap.

### Key Points:
- **The Pharisees' Hypocrisy**:
  1. They were intolerant of Jesus' teachings and left Him in anger.
  2. They plotted to trap Jesus in His words, seeking His downfall.
  3. They conspired with Herodians (secular authorities) to discredit Jesus.
  4. Their flattery masked their true intentions to harm Him.

- **Jesus' Response**:
  1. Jesus revealed their hypocrisy, calling them "hypocrites" and exposing their malicious intent.
  2. He wisely avoided their trap by affirming the need to give to Caesar what is Caesar’s and to God what is God’s.
  3. He demonstrated divine wisdom, balancing civic duty and spiritual devotion.

- **Broader Lessons**:
  1. Christians are called to render both civil obedience and spiritual worship appropriately.
  2. Hypocrisy in faith is condemned, and sincerity in actions is emphasized.
  3. Jesus' teachings challenge both religious and secular abuses of power.

### Key Quote:
> "*Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.*"  
> **(Matthew 22:21)**
