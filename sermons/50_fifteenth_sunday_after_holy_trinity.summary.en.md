title: Fifteenth Sunday After Holy Trinity
---

**Introduction**  
This summary captures the essence of Jan Hus's sermon on the Fifteenth Sunday after Holy Trinity, drawn from Matthew chapter 6, verses 24-33. Hus emphasizes the impossibility of serving both God and material wealth, urging believers to trust in God's providence and prioritize spiritual over worldly concerns.  

**Bullet points**  
- **Dual Allegiance**: Jan Hus stresses that one cannot serve both God and mammon (material wealth), as they are opposing masters.  
- **Trust in Providence**: Believers are encouraged not to worry excessively about food or clothing, as God cares for His creation more than for birds or lilies.  
- **Prioritize Spiritual Goals**: Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all necessary earthly provisions will be provided.  
- **Condemnation of Greed**: Hus criticizes those obsessed with wealth, warning that such preoccupation draws them away from God.  
- **Examples of Faith**: Jan Hus cites birds and lilies as examples of God’s care, emphasizing that humans, being more valuable, will certainly receive divine provision.  
- **Warning Against Distractions**: Excessive concern for worldly needs distracts from spiritual growth and God’s kingdom.  

**Key quote**  
> "Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you." – Jan Hus, quoting Matthew 6:33
