# Second Sunday After Easter Night

From John 10:11–16

At that time Jesus said: “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep. But the hired man, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, abandons the sheep, and runs away. Then the wolf seizes and scatters the sheep. And the hired man runs away because he is a hired man and the sheep do not really matter to him. I am the good shepherd, and I know my sheep [chosen from eternity for salvation], and my sheep know me [by faith]. Just as the Father [from eternity] has known me, so I know the Father, and I lay down my life for my sheep [chosen for salvation]. And I have other sheep [chosen ones] that are not yet [by faith] from this sheepfold [that is, the fellowship of the godly]. I must [by the will of the Holy Trinity] bring them also [into the holy fellowship], and they will listen to my voice [in a way that leads them to salvation]. And there will be one flock [the assembly of the elect] and one shepherd [Christ, who feeds all with his body, his grace, and also their bodily needs].”

This holy reading is like a very clear mirror held up to the true deputies of Christ, and at the same time it is a very open condemnation of all false prelates who do not follow Christ.

A. Our gracious Savior lays this foundation of faith: that he himself is the good shepherd. He is good not by some outside accident, but from eternity, because he is God. Others can be good only in an accidental way: sometimes good, sometimes evil, or at least they can become evil. But he cannot be evil, because he is eternal goodness itself.

So when he says, “I am the good shepherd,” this does not mean proud boasting. He says it as the true God and true man, whom pride and any sin can never touch.

From this you must learn three things.

First, it is impossible that any other human being could ever be such a good shepherd as Christ is.

Second, no one at all can be a good shepherd except by sharing in the goodness of this shepherd.

Third, no other shepherd is worthy of praise unless he follows Christ the shepherd in virtue. For virtue — which stands in the middle between sins — must take its beginning from the Son of God, who is the middle person between the Father and the Holy Spirit. So, as far as a person — and especially a spiritual shepherd — turns aside from following Christ, that far he strays from the path of truth.

B. From this we also have proof that the life of clergy — and especially of popes, bishops, and parish priests — must be judged by comparing their deeds with the pattern of Christ’s works. If they follow Christ, then they are worthy of praise. If they do not follow him, then they are worthy of judgment. And the more closely someone follows Christ, the more worthy he is of praise; the more he turns from following Christ, the more worthy he is of punishment.

After Christ lays down this foundation of faith, that he is the good shepherd, he immediately shows what kind of work belongs to such a shepherd when he says:

C. “The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep.”

Three main duties belong to a shepherd.

First, to give the flock good, healthy pasture.

Second, to protect the sheep from violence.

Third, to heal the sick sheep.

These three duties belong in the highest way to Christ alone. Only he is the shepherd who can feed his faithful ones with his own word; when others feed, they do not feed with their own word but with his.

Second, Christ alone has the power to protect his chosen ones against the devil. For he alone, as a man, has authority over all people and over all devils. So he alone is the shepherd who can truly defend his sheep against all devils.

Third, he alone is the one who “takes away the sins of the world.” And because there is no sickness worse for his sheep — the believers mentioned in this reading — than sin, what other shepherd can heal these sheep from the leprosy of sin as graciously as Christ? So the greatest duty of a shepherd — to heal his subjects and help them — would be, if needed, to lay down his life for the sheep.

Many have done this, but not by their own power as Christ did. He, having authority to lay down his life and to take it up again, truly laid it down unto death for his sheep. Others did it only by his help, and not in such a way that by their death they cleansed their sheep from sins or redeemed them from eternal damnation. Therefore, he is the very best shepherd, the one who laid down his life for his sheep.

Once you know what a good shepherd is, it becomes easier to recognize an evil shepherd. So Christ immediately points out the marks of the bad shepherd, saying: “But the hired man, who is not a shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, abandons the sheep, and runs away.”

D. Know this: a hired man is one who serves someone for temporal or bodily gain, in order to receive payment from him. He is called a hired man because he serves for a hire, or a wage, that is, for earthly pay.

From this you must conclude that all priests who have taken on the office of shepherd, but have not clothed themselves with Jesus Christ — who do not carry out that office for the glory of God, the salvation of their own soul, and the benefit of the holy Church, first living well themselves — all such men are not true shepherds; they are false hirelings.

So we must also conclude that all present-day prelates — that is, all who have been raised above others in office — who look mainly to bodily comfort, or who care more about bodily profit than spiritual profit, are all false hirelings. Unless they repent, they will be damned, because they seek more their own gain than the gain of their Lord Jesus Christ. For if they truly sought the profit of the highest shepherd, they would work more diligently for the salvation of souls than for earthly gain; and they would not have turned their backs on that work.

And those will surely be condemned without excuse who do nothing at all of the shepherd’s office: who do not teach the people and only feed themselves. For the prophet Ezekiel says in chapter 34, verse 2: “This is what the Lord God says: Woe to the shepherds who feed themselves!” And a little later, in Ezekiel 34:8–10: “The shepherds have not looked after my flock, but the shepherds have fed themselves and have not fed my sheep. Therefore, shepherds, hear the word of God: This is what the Lord God says: Look, I myself will demand my flock from their hand. I will take my sheep back from them. I will command them to stop so that they no longer pasture my flock, and I will also stop them from feeding themselves.”

Here you have the very words of God himself. Weighing them, the saints write that shepherds who do not feed the people with God’s word will be condemned.

St. Isidore says: “Priests are damned for the sins of the people when they do not teach them, even though the people are ignorant, and when they do not correct them when they sin.”

And St. Augustine says: “There are not many priests who preach the word of God rightly; but there are many who keep silent to their own damnation: some through lack of learning, because they do not want to be taught; others because of laziness and fear of losing earthly gains if they preach the word of God. But neither the ignorant nor the lazy can be justified for the sin of their silence. For the ignorant should not be placed over others if they cannot preach, and those who can preach should not be silent, even if they are not placed over others.” So far Augustine.

And St. Gregory says (Dist. 43), referring to Exodus 28:35: “‘The sound must be heard when the priest goes into the sanctuary before the Lord, so that he does not die.’ Truly, whenever a priest goes in or comes out and no sound is heard from him, he dies; he provokes the anger of the hidden Judge if he goes about without the sound of preaching.”

Gregory explains the Scripture, which tells how God commanded Moses that the priest must not go into the temple unless he was wearing a garment with little bells that would ring so the people could hear him, and he must wear it also when he came out. Any priest without the bells was to die. Gregory interprets this for our time: that a priest must “ring out” with God’s word under penalty of eternal death, and he must hang bells on his garment — that is, on his good works, which are the true priestly robe. As David says in Psalm 132:9: “Let your priests be clothed with righteousness.” Thus, says Gregory, the bells hang from the priest’s garment when the pathway of life is shown by the sound of his tongue and by the witness of his deeds.

You see now how shepherds who do not pasture Christ’s sheep — being mere hirelings — are worthy of condemnation. Woe to them who take the office of shepherd only for bodily advantage. Of every such man Christ says that he is “a hired man, who sees the wolf,” that is, the devil (as Augustine and Gregory explain), “and abandons the sheep and runs away.”

Understand this: he “sees the wolf,” that is, the devil, when he sees the devil’s works in a person — adultery, fornication, or any other deed of the devil. He “abandons the sheep” when he ignores such sins, even though he could teach them that this is evil, and he “runs away.”

St. Gregory says: “He ‘runs away’ not because he changes his place, but because he refuses to give help. The wolf ‘seizes’ the sheep when the devil drags souls into the pleasure of sin. When the devil has led a person into mortal sin, then he has seized and strangled that person’s soul. He ‘scatters’ them when he draws them away from the unity of love: driving one sheep up to the height of pride, another into the pit of laziness, another into the thorns of greed, and yet another into the filth of fornication.”

F. Notice carefully how Christ speaks: “The hired man, who is not the shepherd, and does not own the sheep.” He says two things: first, that the hired man is not a shepherd; second, that the sheep are not his own.

Let us ask: who is not a shepherd? Certainly the one who does not feed. Just as the one who tends four‑footed animals is called a shepherd of sheep, so without question the one who does not feed Christ’s sheep is not a shepherd.

But suppose he does feed. Then ask: with what, and why does he feed them? If he feeds them with the word of God and by the example of holy deeds, then he is a shepherd; and such a man neither abandons the sheep nor runs from them. But if he feeds them with stories, errors, and false speeches, then he is a thief who steals the word of God from the people so that they do not hear it. Or if he feeds them, but mainly for bodily advantage, he is a hireling.

St. Augustine says about Christ’s words “he is a hired man”: “What does it mean that he is a hired man? It means he looks for temporal wages; he will not remain forever in the house [that is, in the kingdom of heaven].”

And St. Gregory says: “There are some who, when they love earthly property more than the sheep, rightly lose the name ‘shepherd.’ For he is not a shepherd but a hireling who does not tend God’s sheep for inward love of them, but for bodily gain. He is truly a hireling who holds the shepherd’s place but does not seek the profit of souls. He is only eager for earthly gain and rejoices in the honor of being a prelate.” So far Gregory.

A man becomes a hireling in three ways. First, when he takes on the office and then neglects the sheep. Second, when he runs away in time of persecution. These two Christ has already mentioned. Third, as contained in the very word “hireling”: that he seeks the pay, the earthly reward.

G. Consider how many hirelings there are — and where are the true shepherds? Sadly, many have turned into wolves or hirelings. As for thieves and robbers who climb in some other way than through Christ, there is no counting them. Who could number them, when Christ himself says just after this passage (John 10:8) that all who came before him — that is, those who came not through him — “are thieves and robbers,” ravenous wolves. And Christ commands us to beware of them carefully, saying (Matthew 7:15): “Watch out for false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.”

False prophets come with money‑selling indulgences; they wear “sheep’s clothing,” that is, they stand in priestly office and power, which outwardly looks like Christ’s sheep. Their “sheep’s voice” says: “Your sins will be forgiven!” But inside they are the hunger of a wolf, craving money. They quickly show themselves as wolves: like wolves lifting their heads high and howling.

David describes them in Psalm 73:8–9: “They plan evil and speak deception; they talk arrogantly from on high. They set their mouths in heaven, and their tongue drags along the earth.” Whom does the prophet mean when he says, “They plan deception”? Those who cleverly invent devices to rob the people, and then speak wickedly from a high place, saying that anyone who opposes them is a heretic and that they have the power to curse him to hell.

Then the prophet adds: “They have set their mouths in heaven” — that is, they claim that they have authority to open the kingdom of heaven and that whoever gives them money will receive forgiveness of sins and release from punishments, and that if he dies he will immediately be in heaven. And as Pope Clement commands in a bull, he orders the holy angels to take straight to heaven the soul of anyone who dies during a pilgrimage.

Does that not sound like lifting their heads above heaven, above God’s angels? Is it not the true howling of wolves?

The prophet then shows these wolves more clearly: “Their tongue drags along the earth” — that is, they speak always seeking earthly things, as they show at once by their talk: “Give us money.” Their tongues and their writings pull hard so that those who give will gain something, or at least will help others to give.

So these wolves have multiplied and joined with the hirelings until they now bite and murder the faithful shepherds and the sheep who feed on the true pasture of God’s word — calling them heretics.

These wolves get their marching orders from the great wolf Antichrist, about whom Jeremiah says (5:6): “A wolf of the evening has ravaged them.” What is this “wolf of the evening” devouring the people? It is Antichrist at the end of the world — at evening — when there is no beam of the sun of Christ to enlighten the understanding and inflame the desire with love. For Christ himself prophesied (Matthew 24:12) that toward the day of judgment “wickedness will increase and love will grow cold.”

So Antichrist devours the sheep by sending out lesser wolves. About them Christ said to his faithful ones (Matthew 10:16): “Look, I am sending you out as sheep among wolves.”

So you may understand, if you will, that the wolf is not only the devil and Antichrist, but also anyone who by force or trickery devours others’ property and tears people to pieces with slander. St. Gregory says that the wolf comes upon the sheep whenever any unjust man or robber oppresses the faithful and the humble poor. And the one who seemed to be a shepherd, but was not, abandons the sheep and runs. So far Gregory.

Christ then gives the reason why the hireling runs away. He says: “The hired man runs away because he is a hired man and does not really care about the sheep.”

St. Gregory comments: “The very fact that he is a hireling is the reason he runs away.” As if to say: The man who is over the sheep but loves not the sheep themselves, only the earthly gain, cannot stand in the danger that threatens them.

So from Christ’s words and from Gregory we see why the hireling runs from the sheep: because he was seeking gain, not truly loving the sheep. If he truly loved them and were a shepherd chosen by Christ, then he would stand against the devil even to death for his brothers.

H. For Christ says, “The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.” And the apostle John writes (1 John 3:16): “This is how we have known the love of God: he laid down his life for us, and we also ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.”

This is a solid argument. Because Christ did this, and sent the apostles to do the same, and other ministers after them, they too must do it.

Augustine proves it this way: rightly ordered love wants this, that every person should love the soul of his neighbor more than his own body. Therefore, for the salvation of his neighbor’s soul, a person should be ready to lay down his body in death, if that is necessary. Reason shows that a lesser good must be given up for a greater good. Since bodily life is a lesser good than the life and salvation of the soul, the body must be given up when the time calls for it.

Another article of faith is this: that anyone who lives in love — by grace — will risk his life even to death for his neighbor’s salvation, and he will be honored with the joy of heaven. Therefore, a faithful Christian, and especially the shepherd of Christ’s sheep, must be ready to risk his life against the devil and Antichrist for the sake of the flock, even unto death.

I. Here St. Augustine raises a question. Since the apostles were true shepherds and not hirelings, why did they run away when men sought to kill them? Did they not contradict Christ’s command: “When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next” (Matthew 10:23)? How can both be true: that a hireling runs away when he sees the wolf coming, and yet Christ commands his apostles to flee?

Bishop Honoratus wrote this same question to Augustine and asked also how he himself should act when men sought to destroy him. He said: “Look, in one reading Christ says: ‘When they persecute you in one place, flee to another.’ And now Christ says that ‘the hired man, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, abandons the sheep, and runs away.’ How shall I act, so that I obey that word of Christ and yet not be a hireling by fleeing?”

In answer to this question Augustine wrote him an entire little book and discusses the matter at length. In the end he settles on this: First ask whether the persecution is deadly for all, both clergy and laity, or not for all. If it is deadly for all, can all escape together to another safe place? If they can, then all may flee. But if not all are being put to death, then either only the clergy are in danger or only the laity.

If it is only the laity, then the clergy should not flee; the lay people may escape, for they are not the shepherds. But if only the clergy are in danger of death, then not all the clergy should flee. Otherwise they would be hirelings, leaving the people without spiritual care — without God’s word and without baptism.

And if the people themselves were to say to them, “Go away so that you will not be killed,” the clergy must answer that they will not go, because they love the people’s souls more than their own bodies.

Augustine goes on: “But what if all the priests are killed? Who will then remain to teach the people?” He answers that not all must stay; some must preserve themselves for the future benefit of the Church.

But how should this be done, if someone says, “Let me flee, and you stay”? Augustine says: Whoever speaks that way is either more fearful than the others and wants simply to run, or he thinks that he alone will be the most useful to the church later. In that case he is proud. What then should be done?

Augustine answers: No one should decide it for himself, but all together should decide that one or a few are to be spared for the future benefit of the people. But what if they do not know whom to choose? Then they should cast lots, and the one on whom the lot falls should go.

Some may object: “We never read anywhere in Scripture of such a lot being used.” Augustine replies: Even if it has never happened before, if it happens, it can still be profitable.

If the persecutors are seeking only one particular person to kill, and without that person the people can still have spiritual care, then that man may withdraw for the future good of the Church. Just as the apostle Paul escaped from Damascus when the believers lowered him in a basket over the wall, and as St. Athanasius fled when the emperor wanted to destroy him. By fleeing, Athanasius later greatly benefited the holy Church against heretics. He was the one who wrote that confession of faith that we commonly sing or say at Prime in Latin, which begins *Quicumque vult salvus esse* — in Czech, “Whoever wishes to be saved.”

But if by his withdrawing the people would be left without God’s word or without baptism, then he must not leave. If he runs from the sheep and abandons them to the devil, he reveals himself to be a hireling, loving his own body more than the salvation of his neighbors.

This is how Augustine answers Honoratus’s question.

I myself — trusting in God’s grace, taking counsel with many people whose feet I am not worthy to kiss, and guided by Augustine’s teaching — when I saw that the people still had plenty of God’s word and other spiritual care, withdrew when they sought my death. Then later I returned and preached. And again, when there was to be a meeting for peace by the king’s request, and with permission to preach to the people, I again withdrew.

After that, when in that year nothing came of it for the freeing of God’s word, I again preached, and they continually put a stop to the services. This stopping of worship caused great pressure among the people. They would not baptize, would not bury the dead. Fearing great turmoil among the people, I again withdrew.

And I do not know whether I acted well or badly, like a hireling. Will these reasons help me so that I will not be judged a hireling? Still, this comforts me: that my purpose is this — if I knew that by staying I would be sinning, then, by God’s help, I would be willing to give up this life and risk their stopping of services, which now most of all holds me back. For the people will not consider the truth of God enough to live without their services for a time and to bury their dead wherever they can, or to baptize their children themselves in such need, until God himself tears apart these Antichrist nets.

K. Antichrist has no stronger net than the stopping of God’s service. By it priests force their will on people and get what they want. With this net they defend their greed and riches. With this net they have pulled themselves away from suffering and wrapped themselves in wealth and bodily comfort, so that the first holy Christians — and especially the priests — rejoiced to suffer when their goods were taken, when they were insulted, beaten, tortured, and killed. Instead of stopping God’s service, they prayed all the more, offered Christ more often, and preached more boldly.

But now the “holy” priests who have gone backward have so surrounded themselves with Antichrist’s decree that if someone takes anything from a priest — even justly — or catches a priest in adultery or robbery, they immediately stop worship everywhere. If someone exposes a priest as a fornicator or thief, or if someone gives a priest a slap in a tavern during a quarrel over dice or over someone’s wife, then they bring lawsuits and curses. If anyone sheds a priest’s blood, they stop the service and rush to Rome, saying that no one but the pope can absolve a man who has wounded a priest.

But when a priest cuts off someone’s hand or foot or kills an innocent man, they do not curse that priest, nor do they stop the service. Why? Because “the devil does not put out the eye of the devil.” They even say: “That priest is a man of courage, who dares to club a fellow with a fiddle!”

So the devil has, step by step, very cleverly tightened this net. At first he pushed evil men to slaughter the good. When he saw that the more they killed, the more the number of good people grew, he planned heavier tortures. That too failed.

Then he invented this new evil: he took the sword away from the good and placed it in the hands of the wicked. By “sword” I mean the word of Christ about excommunication, which they call a curse. Christ gave it so that for open mortal sin, after three warnings, if a person would not turn from his public sin, the godly should not keep fellowship with him. The devil cunningly handed this sword to the wicked against the good, so that simoniacs, adulterers, fornicators, misers, and open enemies of God now excommunicate those who preach God’s word and rebuke their sins.

The devil began this already against our Lord Jesus. As John writes (9:34), the priests, bishops, and lawyers, doing the devil’s will, excommunicated the man who had been born blind and to whom Christ had given sight, because he bore witness to Christ. For the Jews had already agreed that anyone who confessed Jesus to be the Christ would be thrown out of the synagogue.

About this kind of excommunication Christ warned his disciples on Maundy Thursday (John 16:1–2): “I have told you these things so that you will not fall away. They will put you out of the synagogues. Indeed the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering service to God. They will do these things because they have not known the Father or me.”

Here we see clearly what has become of this “curse” — this excommunication — and what is still happening: it springs from ignorance of God the Father and the Son and from the delusion that by killing God’s servants they are serving God.

L. So the devil has cunningly multiplied this curse and stretches it everywhere to grab wealth for the clergy, to defend that wealth, to pull the whole world under their feet, and especially to protect their sins — above all, to keep anyone from preaching against them. That is why they forbid, under the threat of a curse, any preaching about priests before the common people, unless it is flattery for their praise and bodily benefit.

So if someone preaches that priests are “gods,” that they are “creators of God,” that they have the power to save and damn whomever they wish, that no one can be saved without them, that no one may rebuke them, and that they must eat, drink, and wear what is best — such a preacher is honored as a great and noble preacher. He is allowed to preach.

But if someone preaches that priests must not commit fornication, must not rob people by greed and simony, must leave other men’s wives alone, that one adequate income is enough for the man who is worthy and works with and for the people, that they must not buy and sell sacraments and benefices — then at once they accuse him of attacking holy priesthood and destroying the holy Church, calling him a heretic who must not preach. They bring lawsuits; then they curse; and when even that devilish net is not enough, they stop the worship of God.

They stretch this devil’s net as far as they possibly can. To get their way they would, if they could, forbid everyone to serve God at all.

God has commanded: “Preach, baptize, do this in remembrance of me, pray and do not cease.” Antichrist says the opposite: “Do not preach, do not baptize, do not say Mass, do not do this in remembrance of Christ, do not pray — stop!”

The simple people think all this is right, because they have been taught so, and they cannot understand that if an officer of a king would command all the king’s servants to stop their office and service because one of them was bad or because a good servant of the king would not do that officer’s wicked will, he would be a wicked officer and the servants should not obey him. It is the same here: the one who stops the good from serving King Christ and from doing the office he commanded is a rebel against God.

I have written elsewhere in Latin about this net of stopping worship, in my books on the holy Church. At first, a pope stretched this net when a cardinal in Rome was wounded: the pope stopped all worship throughout Rome.

Afterward Antichrist spread this net wider and wider, especially so that no one might dare to lay a hand on his priests. Or if anyone did, they would unfold the net at once.

In our own times, near the end of the world, he has spun the net more cleverly and finely than ever, so finely covered that the birds of Christ, flying with the wind of the Holy Spirit, might not see it and escape. But God will soon give his people understanding so that they will tear up these nets and praise God freely, without stopping his worship for Antichrist’s sake.

Blessed be God that in his Holy Scripture he has not given them these nets, but rather has commanded his disciples to tear them, so that his praise might always continue among the people.

If it is God’s holy will, I will not fear their stopping of services. It might even be better if such enemies of God’s word neither held services nor baptized at all. At the time God shows me by his holy teaching that the moment is right, I will preach God’s word again to strengthen Christ’s sheep.

M. Christ goes on in the reading: “I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me.”

He says again, “I am the good shepherd,” to confirm and explain it more clearly to us, and to show that he is a shepherd both as God and as man. He proves he is the good shepherd in three ways.

First, he knows his sheep: “I know my sheep.”

Second, he lays down his life for them: “I lay down my life for the sheep.”

Third, he has great diligence and care for them: “I must bring them also.”

Is he not then truly the good shepherd, who knows all his sheep, lays down his life for them, and cares for them with great diligence even unto death? If you can find a better shepherd, then you are claiming to be wiser than God.

Christ says, “I know my sheep” — that is, I know them with an eternal, saving knowledge — “and my sheep know me” — now by living faith, and after death by eternal love — “they know me, their own shepherd.”

“Just as the Father has known me” — with eternal, loving knowledge — “so I know the Father” with that same divine knowledge, for I am his eternal Son.

By this knowledge the sheep do not know Christ, for they are not from eternity. They know him now by faith, and in blessedness they shall know him as he is. Their knowledge begins here and is fulfilled in the joy of heaven.

So Christ, as God, has the highest knowledge with the Father, and as man he has a human knowledge of the Father, closely united with that divine knowledge, so that knowing the will of God the Father he willingly dies for the sheep.

Therefore he rightly adds: “And I lay down my life for the sheep” — that is, for the elect, chosen for salvation. This is the most diligent work, eternally chosen by God and commanded to Christ as man by the Holy Trinity: that he should lay down his life unto death for his sheep.

And this work is not only for the benefit of the Jews, from whose nation Christ was born and to whom he was first sent, but also for others from among the nations.

So he says: “I have other sheep” — that is, Gentiles chosen for salvation — “who are not of this sheepfold” — not from the Jewish people, whose assembly of the godly is the sheepfold. “I must bring them also” — not unwillingly, but by the choice and will of the Holy Trinity — “and they will listen to my voice,” that is, to my word, in a way that leads them to salvation. “And there will be one flock and one shepherd.”

Some understand “one flock” as the final complete turning of the Jews to faith in Christ; others understand it as the full gathering of all the elect, who will finally dwell with Christ. This second understanding is sure. For certainly it is true that all the elect will in the end truly hear Christ’s voice; they will be one assembly, which Christ calls a flock, and one shepherd of that assembly is our beloved Christ.

So for all the elect until the day of judgment there is one flock — the holy Church militant, the Church still fighting. After the day of judgment there will be one flock — the holy Church triumphant, the Church that has overcome — that is, the assembly of all the saints who have conquered the flesh, the world, and the devil, always having one shepherd, our Lord Jesus Christ.

From the number of these sheep Judas the apostle was not included, though he was chosen by Christ to be a bishop. He was not chosen for salvation. For no one who is chosen for salvation will perish, and no one who is eternally foreknown for damnation will be saved. So St. Augustine proves.

Understand this clearly: “Elect” is the one whom God has chosen so that, living well, he will in the end be saved. “Foreknown” is the one whom God has seen beforehand that, living wickedly, he will be condemned.

Amen.
