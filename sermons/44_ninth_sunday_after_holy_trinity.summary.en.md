Jan Hus's sermon on Luke 16:1-9 (the Parable of the Dishonest Manager) emphasizes accountability, wise stewardship, and mercy. This summary distills key teachings from the text, focusing on how believers—especially leaders—should manage God-given resources.

**Key Points**:
- **The Parable's Meaning**:
  - The rich man (Christ) represents God, and the manager symbolizes human stewards (especially clergy).
  - The manager wastes his master’s wealth and faces judgment, illustrating the consequences of poor stewardship.
- **Three Warnings**:
  1. Being accused before God for misuse of resources.
  2. Giving an account of one’s stewardship.
  3. Losing authority and facing eternal consequences.
- **Stewardship Lessons**:
  - Wealth should be used for mercy, not pride or excess (Luke 16:19-23 warns against the rich man’s fate).
  - Leaders must guide others rightly or face accountability (Ezekiel 3:17-18).
- **Call to Action**:
  - Use worldly resources to "make friends" (serve others) so they may welcome you into eternal dwellings (Luke 16:9).
  - Almsgiving must come from justly gained wealth, not exploitation (Sirach 34:24 condemns offerings from oppression).

**Key Quote**:
   > "A já pravi vám, čiňte sobě přátely z zbožie zlosti, at kdy nedostatečni budete, vezmú vás u věčné přiebytky."  
   > ("And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal dwellings." — Luke 16:9)
