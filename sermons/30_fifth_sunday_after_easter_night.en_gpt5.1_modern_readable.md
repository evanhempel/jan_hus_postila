# Fifth Sunday After Easter Night

From St. John, chapter 16, verses 23–30.

At that time the Lord Jesus said: Truly, truly, I tell you: if you ask the Father for anything in my name, he will give it to you. Until now you have not asked for anything in my name, because of your foolishness and confusion. Ask, and you will receive grace now, when you ask in my name, so that your joy may be full in the blessed life to come. I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech, in hard parables. The hour is coming after I ascend into heaven when I will no longer speak to you in parables as before, but I will speak plainly to you about my Father so that you will fully understand. On that day, whenever the Holy Spirit stirs you to ask in my name, you will ask. And I am not saying to you—as if I were speaking empty words that might not come to pass—that I, as a man, will ask the Father for you, for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. I came out from the Father by eternal begetting and came into the world by taking on flesh; again I am leaving the world—that is, leaving the people in this world, no longer to live among them in bodily fellowship—and I am going to the Father by my suffering and then my ascension.

His disciples said to him: See, now you are speaking plainly and are not saying any parable or figure of speech. Now we know that you know all things, and that no one needs to question you, that is, to test you. In this we believe that you have come from God: from the Father by eternal begetting, from the Holy Trinity as man by being created, and from the Virgin Mary by becoming flesh and being born.

In this holy reading a sure promise of being heard in prayer is laid before us—if we ask for the right things. Therefore we should listen to this holy reading with great joy.

St. Augustine says: “The words of our Lord which you have just heard, dearest brothers, must be received with all desire. If they are received with more eager faith, then our hearts will be comforted with greater joy.”

And what could be more comforting than that our Lord says: “Truly, truly I tell you, if you ask the Father for anything in my name, he will give it to you.”

So let us weigh this: who is to ask, how he is to ask, what he is to ask for, through whom he is to ask, and from whom he is to ask, if he wants to be heard.

Who? A righteous person.  
How? In the right way.  
What? Something worthy.  
Through whom? Through Jesus.  
From whom? From God the Father.

Whoever orders his prayer in this way will, without fail, receive from the heavenly Father what he asks.

If someone does not believe it, let him hear the oath of the Savior, who says: “Truly, truly I tell you: if you ask…,” and in other words, “if you ask the Father for anything in my name, he will give it to you.”

Now you hear who makes this promise under an oath: Christ himself, true God and true man—saying “truly” once on account of his divinity, and “truly” again on account of his humanity.

If a great king, or the pope—who often lies—were to promise you so earnestly under oath, the first that he would give you a village, a castle, or a horse, and the second that he would give you a bishopric, how happy and eager you would be to do whatever they commanded, even though they might die before they could give you anything.

But now the King of the whole world and the highest Bishop, who cannot fail and can no longer die, promises—and he is able to give a person whatever best thing he can rightly desire. And yet people are not as eager to ask from this King and Bishop as they are to beg from mortal liars and to serve them more than God!

Let anyone who wishes consider how diligent people are when they petition the pope or the king. In that moment they think of nothing else, they do not look elsewhere, they are careful not to slip in a single word, or say or do anything displeasing. But when they pray to God the Father, sometimes they do not even know what they are saying, their thoughts wander elsewhere, they entertain themselves inwardly, and think more about lust, flirting, and wretched possessions than about the Lord God.

Such people receive nothing, because they ask in an unworthy manner. But whoever wants to be heard must arrange himself as I have said.

First, he must consider who he is. Is he a disciple of Christ, among those to whom it was said: “I tell you, if you ask for anything”? For the holy disciples to whom this was said stood in the place of all faithful Christians. Whoever follows Christ in gentleness, humility, and other virtues, keeping his commandments, that one is his disciple. He himself says: “Truly, you will be my disciples, and by this all will know that you are my disciples, if you do the things that I command you.”

Therefore misers, the sexually immoral, the proud, gluttons, drunkards, gamblers, hypocrites—who belong to the devil’s school and are his disciples—when they ask for something, they will not be heard.

And how many there are in that company, especially among priests and lawyers! To them Christ says in Matthew 15:7–9: “Isaiah prophesied well about you: ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. They worship me in vain, teaching human teachings and commandments.’”

From this you learn that anyone who wants to ask God for something, and to be heard, must keep his commandments and so have faith, hope, and love.

Second, he must ask in the right way. The one who is living rightly and asks for things that are fitting for his salvation is asking rightly and in order.

There are some things we should ask for immediately and directly, without adding, “If it is your will.” These are the things Christ himself placed in the backbone of prayer—the Lord’s Prayer—such as the hallowing of God’s name, the coming of his kingdom, the doing of his will.

But for other things we must add this condition: “Your will be done,” or “if it is your will.” Christ our dear Lord himself prayed this way, saying in Luke 22:42: “My Father, if you are willing, take this suffering from me. Yet let your will be done.”

He did this to give us an example. He knew well that he must suffer, and that God the Father would not change his will, and neither did he wish to change his own will in that matter. But he wanted to teach us how to pray, because we do not know what God wills or delights in with regard to such things.

We should also often add this condition: “If this is for our salvation.” So when we pray for health, for peace, for bodily needs or desires, we should always set this in our hearts: “if these things would be beneficial for our salvation; but if they would hinder us, may God not give them to us.”

And from this you immediately see the third point:

Third, what should you ask for? You should ask for whatever helps your salvation, and every one of us must pray for that. Since forgiveness of sins and growth in virtue help our salvation best, we must earnestly ask for these. But we must not ask in order to be lords, or rich, or exalted in this world, lest that word of Christ be spoken to us in Matthew 20:22: “You do not know what you are asking.”

Fourth, we must know through whom, or for whose sake, we must ask. It is through Jesus. He himself says: “If you ask the Father for anything in my name, he will give it to you.”

So the prayers of priests commonly end with these words to God the Father: “Through our Lord Jesus Christ, graciously hear us.” And understand that when you say “through Jesus,” you mean through the humanity of Jesus, which stands best before God on our behalf, so that we may be heard.

That is why Jesus teaches, “If you ask in my name.” And “Jesus” means “Savior.” St. Augustine says: “Whatever is asked against salvation is not asked in the name of the Savior.”

From this you learn that everyone prays wrongly who asks for something that would hinder his salvation. How many there are who pray wrongly in this way! They pray for bodily beauty, for great wealth, for promotion in the world, for benefices, for revenge on their enemies—even on those who are leading them toward salvation and would gladly see them live well.

In this matter women commonly go astray. They ask God to give their children honor and wealth. St. John Chrysostom says about such mothers that they generally ask riches and dignity for their children, but they do not ask God for their children—that is, they do not ask that God would give himself to them.

Fifth, we must ask from the Father, for Christ says: “If you ask the Father for anything”—that is, God.

Here understand, as St. Augustine explains, that this word “Father” in this place signifies the whole Holy Trinity, not only the person of God the Father. So also in the Lord’s Prayer, when we say “Our Father,” that word “Father” means the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, for each of the three persons is our heavenly Father who created us.

Thus, when Christ says, “If you ask my Father for anything,” it means: “If you ask God, who is three persons.” For as man Christ is created by the three persons, and as such is a son of all three, just as any other created human being is. But because he is the Son of God and the second Person of the Holy Trinity, as Son he has the one Father whom he so often names in this reading.

And without contradicting St. Augustine’s explanation, we may also in this reading understand the word “Father” to mean the person of the Father alone, where he says “my Father,” and again, “I will ask the Father for you, for the Father himself loves you,” and so on to the end of the passage.

Now you have seen who must ask, how he must ask, what he must ask for, through whom and from whom he must ask, if he wants to be heard. For he will surely be heard under the oath of Jesus, who says: “Truly, truly I tell you: if you ask for anything”—that is, anything useful for salvation or concerning salvation—“from my Father,” that is, from God and so from the Holy Trinity, “in my name, he will give it to you.”

Our dear Savior did not say, “If you ask *me* for anything,” as he never says elsewhere either. In this he teaches us first to direct our prayer always to God; and second, not to let people pray to us or beg us too much.

In both of these things people go astray. Some turn their prayers more to the saints than to God, making long prayers and running first to the saints rather than to the Lord God. Others delight in being prayed to, enjoy it, and want it—especially those earthly “gods” whom people treat as gods on earth: popes, cardinals, and others who allow people to pray before them, bow to them, and beg them much.

The apostles and other saints did not do this. Rather, they forbade people to kneel before them and drew the people to pray to God, not to them. For they had just received Christ’s teaching, when he said: “If you ask the Father for anything in my name, he will give it to you. Until now you have not asked in my name.”

Understand that because of their foolishness and confusion the disciples had not yet asked the Father in the name of Christ for anything. St. Bede says: “At that time they had not prayed in the Savior’s name, for while they still had the Savior visibly with them, they lifted their minds less to the unseen gifts of their salvation.”

Therefore, so that the disciples would now be lifted up to heavenly things, he says to them: “Ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be full.” St. Bede says: “This is the proper order of reason: Ask, so that your joy may be full, and you will receive.”

He means that when believers pray for their joy to be made full, and according to the order already described, then in the end they will receive full joy in heaven. So only the elect will be heard in their prayer for heavenly joy—and heard surely, for Christ says: “Ask, and you will receive.”

For this certainty St. John says in his first epistle, chapter 3, verses 21–23: “We have confidence before God, and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what is pleasing in his sight.” And God’s command is that we should ask that our joy may be full, and for whatever would help us to that joy.

And because only the elect reach that full joy, therefore Christ’s word, in its final sense, applies only to the elect. Being one of their number, his beloved disciple says in 1 John 5:14: “And this is the confidence we have toward him: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And we know that he hears us.”

From this we can recognize why God does not hear people’s prayers.

First, evil people are not worthy to be heard, and so in the end the wicked will never have full joy.

Second, even good people are sometimes not heard, because at times they ask for things that are not fitting for their salvation. So St. Paul was not heard when, as he himself says, he asked God three times to take away his bodily temptation. God did not grant that, because that temptation was given to him to help him toward a great reward.

Therefore St. Bede says: “The apostle did not ask in the name of Jesus when he asked to be without the temptation he had received as a guard of humility. Without that humility he could not have been saved.”

To this add Paul’s own words in 2 Corinthians 12:7: “So that I would not be lifted up in pride by the greatness of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to beat me.” Thus it was better for the apostle that God did not hear him in that matter.

Again, the saints are sometimes not heard when they pray for others, because those people are not worthy. Samuel the prophet was not heard when he prayed for King Saul, for God said to him in 1 Reg. 16:1 [1 Samuel 16:1]: “How long will you grieve over Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel?”

Also, sometimes the Lord God does not listen and grant at once, but only after a delay, for the better. This he did with the Canaanite woman who followed him and cried out, asking him to deliver her daughter from the devil, as in Matthew 15:22. God acts this way because he wants us to pray to him constantly.

That is why Christ also now says: “Ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be full.” Ask devoutly and without ceasing, and you will receive grace now, so that your joy may be full in the blessedness to come. For that a Christian must especially pray—not for wealth, or praise, or revenge.

Since after Christ’s ascension the apostles had greater love for him and a deeper knowledge of him, Christ, knowing this, tells them that after his ascension he will speak with them plainly, as with greater lovers, and not in parables as before. So he says further: “I have spoken these things to you in parables; the hour is coming when, after my ascension and after the sending of the Holy Spirit, I will no longer speak to you in parables, but I will tell you plainly about my Father.”

He says, “The hour is coming,” to show the certainty of it—as if that hour had already come—in which he will no longer speak in parables but will speak openly to them about his Father. And so Christ did. He taught the apostles about the Holy Trinity and about the hidden things of the kingdom of heaven, as far as was useful for the benefit of the holy Church.

Then he says: “On that day you will ask in my name.” And so it happened. The apostles asked for spiritual things in Christ’s name, not for unnecessary bodily things. In Christ’s name they first baptized, so that the name of Jesus Christ would be proclaimed and exalted; and at the end of their prayers they added the words: “Through our Lord Jesus Christ.”

Further he says: “And I am not saying to you”—that is, I am not saying it in vain, as if it might not happen as I say—“that I, as a man, will ask the Father for you.”

So, faithful servant of Christ, you have now a sure Priest, who promises to ask God the Father for you—and the Father surely hears him for whomever he prays. And the Father loves whoever loves Christ. Therefore he immediately adds: “For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.”

Know that the disciples believed that Christ came from God by eternal begetting, so that from eternity God the Father begets the Son, God, another Person. And after that eternal coming forth, Christ came forth as a creature, as man, from the whole Holy Trinity, and came into the world by taking human nature in the womb of the Virgin Mary, was born, and lived among us. And again he left the world as to his visible fellowship—he no longer lives bodily among us in suffering—and went to the Father when he ascended into heaven.

Thus he says: “I came out from the Father and came into the world; again I am leaving the world and going to the Father.”

Do not imagine that the Son as God moved away from the Father or went anywhere, for as God he is everywhere and cannot move from one place to another. If he could move from one place to another, he would no longer be everywhere and would be lacking. His going out from the Father is without movement; it is his being begotten from the Father. Just as his “coming down from heaven” is his taking on flesh.

Therefore, when the faith says that he “came down from heaven,” understand that he took flesh while being Lord of heaven, but he did not move from heaven. In his humanity he walked in this world; in his spirit he descended into hell; from hell he returned to the world, rising on Sunday from the dead; and from this world, in his humanity, he moved to heaven when he mightily ascended there.

The reading goes on: “His disciples said to him: See, now you are speaking plainly and are not saying any parable.” As if they said: “Because you now speak so plainly to us, while we are still not fully ready, how much more plainly will you speak when that hour comes and we are more prepared—and you are already now telling us this before we even ask you.”

So they add: “Now we know that you know all things and that no one needs to question you,” that is, to test you. By saying this, the disciples had already come to a higher understanding of Christ’s divinity than they had before. So they say: “In this—that is, because you know all things—we believe that you have come from God,” not merely as another man, but with a coming forth higher than all others.

For many—indeed, all the saints—come forth from God by grace. Of John the Baptist Scripture says in John 1:6: “There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.” Christ came from God by grace as man, by the power of the Holy Spirit in his incarnation, and third, as we have said, by being eternally begotten from the Father as God.

Let us also believe that Christ came from God in this way for our salvation. May he himself help us, so that we may praise him forever. Amen.
