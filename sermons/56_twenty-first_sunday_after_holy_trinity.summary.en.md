This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon on John 4:46-53, where Jesus heals the royal official's son. The sermon focuses on themes of faith, humility, and divine power, contrasting human pride with God's impartial grace.

### Key Points:
1. **The Royal Official's Incomplete Faith**  
   - Jan Hus emphasizes the official's partial faith: he believed Jesus could heal but doubted His divine power to do so remotely (John 4:48).  
   - Jesus rebukes this lack of full faith yet still grants the miracle, demonstrating mercy.  

2. **God's Impartiality vs. Human Pride**  
   - Jesus intentionally visits a lowly centurion's servant (unasked) while refusing the royal official's request, exposing human bias toward status (Matthew 8:5-13).  
   - Hus critiques clergy for favoring the wealthy over the poor, contrary to Christ's example (Matthew 25:41-43).  

3. **Warning Against Seeking Signs**  
   - Jesus condemns those who demand miracles as proof (Matthew 12:38-39), urging faith without spectacle.  
   - Hus warns of false prophets performing deceptive signs (Matthew 24:11, 24).  

4. **Earthly vs. Heavenly Kingship**  
   - All earthly rulers are "small kings" compared to Christ, whose kingdom is eternal (Ecclesiastes 10:11).  
   - True believers are "kings" through grace, freedom, and divine adoption (John 8:36; 1 John 2:20).  

5. **Spiritual Interpretation of the Healing**  
   - The son's fever symbolizes sin (e.g., pride, envy) that shakes the soul, just as the boy's body was afflicted.  

### Key Quote:  
> "Nepýchajme, ač co dobrého činíme, nižádný nás skutek nenadýmaj... bohu ohavni jsme."  
> ("Let us not boast in any good we do, nor let any deed inflate us... for we are abominable to God.")  
> —Jan Hus, echoing Saint Gregory's call to humility.
