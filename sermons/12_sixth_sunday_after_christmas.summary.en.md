This summary covers Jan Hus's sermon on Matthew 11:25-30, where Jesus praises God for revealing divine wisdom to the humble rather than the worldly wise, and invites all who labor to find rest in Him.

### Key Points:
1. **Jesus Praises God**:
   - For being Father and Lord of heaven/earth
   - For hiding divine mysteries from the proud (scribes, Pharisees) and revealing them to the humble (disciples)
   - This reflects God's eternal will: "Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure."

2. **Christ's Authority**:
   - All things are given to Him by the Father, proving His equality with God (against heresies like Arianism, Manichaeism)
   - Only the Son fully knows the Father, and vice versa (John 1:18)

3. **Invitation to the Weary**:
   - Christ calls all burdened by sin/law to come to Him for rest
   - His "yoke" (new law of love) is light and sweet compared to the old law’s burdens
   - Rest is found in imitating Christ’s humility and gentleness

4. **Eternal Rest**:
   - True rest comes only in God, as Augustine wrote: "Our hearts are restless until they rest in You."

> **Key Quote**:  
> "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light." (Matthew 11:29-30)
