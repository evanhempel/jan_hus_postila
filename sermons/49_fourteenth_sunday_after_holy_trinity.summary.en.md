This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon on Luke 17:11-19, where Jesus heals ten lepers. The sermon emphasizes Christ's mercy, the lepers' faith, and the importance of gratitude to God.

- **Jesus' Ministry**:  
  - Travels between Samaria (pagan land) and Galilee (Jewish land), showing His mission to all people.  
  - Demonstrates divine power and mercy by healing the lepers.  

- **The Lepers' Response**:  
  1. All ten cry out: *"Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"*—a humble, spiritual, and communal prayer.  
  2. Jesus commands them to show themselves to the priests (fulfilling Old Testament law).  
  3. Only one (a Samaritan) returns to thank Jesus, while the other nine—likely Jews—fail to acknowledge God's grace.  

- **Key Lessons**:  
  - True faith heals both body and soul (Luke 17:19).  
  - Gratitude to God is rare but essential (only 1/10 lepers thanked Him).  
  - Priests (then and now) should guide people to Christ, not seek personal gain.  

- **Symbolism**:  
  - Leprosy represents sin; cleansing signifies forgiveness.  
  - The Samaritan’s return prefigures Gentile inclusion in salvation.  

> **Key Quote**:  
> *"Your faith has made you well."* (Luke 17:19)
