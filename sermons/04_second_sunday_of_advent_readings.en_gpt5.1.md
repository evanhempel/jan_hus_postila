### Reading for the Second Sunday in Advent

Reading for the Second Sunday in Advent.  
Saint Luke writes in chapter 21, verses 25–33.

"At that time Jesus said: There will be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars, and on the earth the distress of peoples because of the roaring of the sea and the waves, men will wither away from fear and from expectation of what is coming upon the whole world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great power and majesty. And when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near. And he told them a parable: Look at the fig tree and all the trees; when they already put forth fruit from themselves, you know that summer is near; so also you, when you see that these things are happening, know that the kingdom of God is near. Amen, I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all things happen; heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away."

Last Sunday we commemorated Christ’s coming in humility and gentleness; today the reading shows Christ’s coming in power and majesty. For there it was said that the King came, gentle and poor, riding on a donkey; but today the reading says that they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great power and glory. And this is so that those who do not want to love him when he is gentle and humble may at least be afraid of him when he is mighty and glorious. And so the remembrance of the first visitation serves to lift up our hope, and the remembrance of the second to keep us in holy fear; for Christians must have both hope and fear. Fear restrains them so that they do not stumble into sin, and hope holds them so that adversities do not crush them. For Solomon says, Prov. 1, 32: Odvrácenie malých zabie je, a zčestie bláznóv zatratí je.

Therefore in today’s reading both fear is set forth and hope is shown: fear or dread from the beginning of the reading up to the words, "And when these things begin to happen"; and then hope begins where it then says: "lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near." Our Savior sets before us both fear and hope, and shows the signs that will happen before his visitation on the Day of Judgment, which will come when he says: "There will be signs in the sun and in the moon." Second, he sets before us his visitation itself, saying: "Then they will see the Son of Man." Third, he sets before us the consolation of the righteous, saying: "Lift up your heads." Fourth, he gives a warning to make us beware of evil. Thus this whole reading is given so that we may carefully look toward the final coming, or visitation, of Christ.

When the disciples asked Christ the Savior about the Day of Judgment on the Mount of Olives after Palm Sunday, saying, Mt. 24, 3: Pověz nám, kdy ty věci budú, a které znamenie navštievenie tvého a skonánie světa? then among other things he answered them, saying: There will be signs in the sun and in the moon and so on. And the Savior sets signs both in the heavenly things, as in the sun, in the moon, in the stars, and in earthly things, as in the earth and in the sea, and in men, who will wither away with fear and dread.

The Savior says: "There will be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars." And what signs? He tells us in the reading of Saint Matthew, chapter 24, verse 29: "The sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven." The sun has already had such a sign, when it was darkened at Christ’s death, Mt. 27, 45, and likewise the moon at that time lost its light, together with the stars, which take their light from the sun. But it can also be understood that the sun—Christ—will be darkened before the Day of Judgment, so that people will not see by a living faith that Sun; and the moon, which signifies the Christian congregation, will not give its light—that is, they will not shine with true teaching and good works; and the stars—that is, people—will fall from heaven, that is, they will fall away from heavenly fellowship. For the dragon, Antichrist, as Saint John testifies in the Revelation, Apok. 12, 4, with his tail will drag down a third of the stars of heaven: not those stars which shine in the sky, for they will neither fall nor be dragged down by the dragon, but will remain there forever; rather, people will fall away from heavenly things through the terror and craftiness of Antichrist and the seduction of his messengers.

Christ prophesied this when he first said to his disciples, Mt. 24, 4–5 and 24: Vizte, ať nižádný vás nesvede, nebť mnozí přijdú ve jméno mé, řkúce: Já jsem Kristus! a mnohé svedú. A potom die, že vstanú falešní prorokové, a dadie znamenie veliká a zázraky, tak aby uvedeni byli v blud, by mohlo býti, i vyvolení. And this is now being very much fulfilled, for Christ’s truth and Christ himself scarcely shine any longer in people; they no longer even want the Scriptures to be read and preached, nor Christ to be named. And if they seize anyone who openly confesses Christ’s truth, they curse him, persecute him, banish him, behead him, torture him, imprison him, and put him to death. Thus even now in Moravia an official and others have killed a faithful man with hunger, and they have made the feet of the priest Martin, a preacher, rot away; and what happened last year in Prague, and what is still being done there now against those who hold to Christ’s truth, is known to many. All this comes from the messengers of Antichrist—false preachers—who, chasing after money from the people to feed their own greed, pride, luxury, and fornication, for money grant the forgiveness of sins, saying that the pope is an earthly god who has power to give, to whomever he wishes and whenever he wishes, the forgiveness of sins. But they do not tell the people that Christ says, Luc. 13, 3: Nebudete-li sě hřiechóv káti, všichni zahynetel For they have so greatly darkened the Truth, Christ, that preachers now name the pope more often than Christ, and they praise and uphold the pope’s decrees more than the law of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Therefore his faithful children are given over to suffering in many lands; in Bohemia and in Moravia, in Meissen and in England and elsewhere there is great affliction, as I know from experience. They murder, torture, and curse faithful priests, and toward Rome there is no road open, for there is the summit of all Antichrist’s evil: pride, greed, fornication, hypocrisy, and simony, so that from Rome all the way to Bohemia simony and greed have poured out. They sell and buy archbishoprics more dearly than many lordships in Bohemia, and they farm out the indulgences, as much as this or that messenger of Antichrist can raise, so that he can extort even more from simple people. Therefore people are withering: some, because they are afraid to confess the truth against that error; others, because, seeing the division among the clergy in preaching, they do not know what they should hold to; a third group are in great distress because others go so badly astray; and a fourth group suffer the shame, accusations of heresy, and murders, and also the great persecution of God’s truth. For "the sea is roaring"—that is, the people of this world, who are compared to the sea. I say it "roars," crying out that those who follow Christ and hold to his truth are the ones who are in error and are heretics. And with this David says, Psalm 93, 4, that the liftings of the sea are wonderful—that is, that people have risen up in a strange way against Christ and against the truth and have raised up their voice; for David again says, Psalm 93, 3: Pozdvihli sú tokové hlasu svého.

Thus there are already signs in the sun—Christ—for because of the increase of sins, people no longer see him with living faith; and there are signs in the moon—that is, in those who ought, having taken the light of Scripture from Christ, to shine for others—that they no longer shine; and there are signs in the stars, that those who ought by their desire to cling to heavenly things have bent their desires toward earthly ways, especially those who ought to shine for others, such as masters and prelates—that is, those set above others in spiritual office. Such learned men, who while living badly make others worse, fall away from eternal light; whereas those who teach others righteousness while living well themselves will shine forever. As the prophet Daniel says, chapter 12, verse 3: Kteříž učeni budú, stkvieti sě budú jako blesk nebeský; a kteříž učie k spravedlnosti mnohé, jako hvězdy na věčné věky, to věz, budú sě stkvieti. See here: the prophet plainly calls good learned men who teach others "stars"; and they have their light from the Sun, Christ, who is the Sun of righteousness, as Malachi says, Mal. 4, 2: Vám bojícím jmena mého vzende slunce spravedlnosti.

But for false priests and preachers that Sun has gone down behind a hill, as the prophet Micah says, chapter 3, verse 6: Zajde slunce nad proroky a bude nad nimi zatmen den. And just before that he says, Micheáš 3, 5: Toto die pán na proroky, kteříž svodie lid mój, kteříž kúsají svými zuby, a káží, že pokoj jest, a nedá-li jim kto v ústa jich co, svat činie na něho boj neb válku. Perhaps this Scripture touches on those who proclaim a crusade against people who will not submit to them according to their will, and call that war "holy" and the fight "holy war," giving even the remission of sins and of punishments to those who help them in the fighting. A strange thing: they cannot free themselves from fleas and flies, and yet they want to free others from the torments of hell by their granting, without even praying for it or otherwise living good lives themselves! But if there is some faithful Christian who preaches against their evils, then they bear hatred toward him, and by their devised malice they shut down the services of God, being unable otherwise to silence the preaching that exposes their wickedness to the people.

By such craftiness Antichrist in the highest degree advances his wickedness against the freedom and honor of our Lord Jesus Christ. I have written fully about this craftiness in other books, both in Czech and in Latin. And it seems to me that this craftiness is the hardest and heaviest burden for faithful Christians. For neither insult, nor torture, nor killing can stop the preaching of the truth in a faithful preacher of Christ who truly loves God; but the planned stopping of the divine services is a great hindrance, not only for the one who would gladly preach but also for the people who would gladly listen. For what can press Christians harder than when they are refused burial, baptism, confession, and the body of the Lord? Among these burdens the heaviest would be if they refused to baptize. But faithful and understanding Christians would break this: priests by not obeying such a command, and other people by not caring where they were buried, and by baptizing their children themselves in a great necessity, and so, with God’s help, they would tear through Antichrist’s nets by which, under the name of holy obedience, he cunningly deceives people.

And this is that extraordinary tribulation of which the Savior says, Mt. 24, 21–22: že bude tehdy trápenie veliké, kaké nikdy nebylo od počátka světa až dotud, aniž bude. A nebyli-li by ukráceni dnové ti, nebyl by spasen každý člověk; ale pro vyvolené božie ukráceni budú dnové ti.

Indeed, the course of this present time gives the faithful an understanding of that holy reading about the signs of the Day of Judgment, so that, noticing the course of events, they may weigh the words of their Savior and, understanding them, may carefully prepare themselves against the craftiness of Antichrist. For after those signs the coming of the Son of God will not be delayed. Of him the reading then says that "the powers of the heavens will be shaken"—that is, the angels, as Saint Gregory says, will move with the Son of Man to judgment against sinners. For the Scripture says, Sap. 5, 18: Nastrojí stvořenie na pomstu nepřátel.

Therefore it goes on to say: "And then they will see the Son of Man"—that is, Jesus Christ, who is the Son not of two human parents but of one human being, the Virgin Mary—"coming"—that is, to judgment—"in a cloud." What sort of cloud that will be, he himself knows! "With great power"—that is, with great power against proud sinners; for the prophet David says, Psalm 97, 3: Oheň přěd ním pojde, a páliti bude vókol všecky nepřátely jeho. "And with majesty"—that is, for the comfort of the righteous. For immediately after, he gives comforting words to his own, saying: "And when these things begin to happen, look up"—that is, lift up your hearts to my help with a pure heart—"and lift up your heads"—that is, your minds. As Saint Gregory says: To lift up the head is to lift the mind to the joy of the heavenly Father. For the Savior then says: "because your redemption is drawing near"—as if he said: now your deliverance will come, and the eternal condemnation of the wicked.

The reading goes on: "And he told them a parable: Look at the fig tree and at all the trees," and so on. The Savior gives his own a similar sign: just as, when the fruit on the trees ripens, summer is near, so also, when plagues, famines, wars, earthquakes, and the signs already mentioned are in the world, then for the faithful the kingdom of God is near—that is, the blessedness that they will have in heaven. Therefore the Savior goes on to say: "So also you, when you see that these things are happening, know that the kingdom of God is near." And our Savior confirms this word with an oath, saying: "Amen, I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away"—that is, mankind will not pass from death into immortality—"until all these things"—that is, the things already mentioned—"happen." He proves this, saying: "Heaven and earth will pass away"—that is, heaven will be changed, so that after the Day of Judgment it will be more beautiful, and the earth will also be changed—"but my words will not pass away"—that is, they will not be changed, but what I have meant by these words will always surely come to pass. That, briefly, about the reading.

Because the merciful Savior often spoke about his last coming, or visitation, warning his faithful and declaring how dreadful it will be, we must therefore carefully remember that coming, value it greatly, and live good lives. He will come to the wicked as One greatly to be feared, so that the condemned will say to the mountains, Ozeáš 10, 8 and Lukáš 23, 30: "Padněte na nás!" He will come as One who will not hear any of the condemned; he will come as One who will reveal every person’s every evil deed to all the angels, people, and devils; he will come as One who will kindle all the condemned with eternal fire; he will come as One who will condemn them to eternal fire and to darkness and to every kind of evil misery. Therefore Saint Gregory says today in the sermon: Ten den, bratřie najmilejší! přěd oči položte. A což kolivěk těžké nynie sě zdá, bude lehké, nebi o tom dni die prorok, Johel 2, 31: Blízko jest den boží, veliký a hrozný velmč, a kto jej strpí? And the prophet Zephaniah says in chapter 2: Blízko jest den boží veliký, blízko a brzký velmě, hlas dne božieho hořký, trápen bude tu silný, den hněvu den ten, den zamúcenie a úzkosti, den truchlosti a psoty, den temnosti a mrákoty, den oblaka a búřě, den trúby a trúbenie. Thus Zephaniah shows that the Day of Judgment will be very dreadful for the wicked.

Of that day the holy Peter writes in 2. Petr. 3, 10–12: Příde den boží jako zloděj, v kterýžto nebesa velikú prudkostí pojdú, a živlové horkostí sě rozbořie, a země, a ta kteráž v ní jsú stvořenie, pálena budú. A poňavadž ty všechny věci mají sě rozplynúti, a kterací my musíme býti v svatých obcováních a dobrotách, čakajíce a chvátajíce k příchodu dne pána našeho Jezu Krista, skrze něhož nebesa hořiece sě rozplynú, a živlové horkostí ohně zprahnúl Thus the Apostle Peter writes about the Day of Judgment, on which day above us will be the Judge on high, offended by the wicked and angry with them; beneath us hell will yawn, dreadful and open; on the right hand all our sins will publicly accuse us; on the left demons will be dragging us into hell; above and around us the world will be burning; before us angels will be driving us into hell; within, our conscience will be biting us cruelly; without, the eternal fire will be burning our bodies; and all the saints will be confirming the sentence and saying with the Judge: "Go, you cursed, into the eternal fire!"

Beloved, as we consider such a heavy and dreadful coming of Christ and the Day of Judgment, let us carefully remember Christ’s first coming: that, having taken flesh, he came into the world and labored for our salvation. Let us be grateful, so that he may now visit us spiritually with his grace, and at our death may find us ready. Let us remember his last dreadful coming, so that we may be sentenced to the heavenly joy. For Saint Gregory says in today’s sermon: Ten den, bratřie najmilejšíl vší neb plnú myslí pamatujte, života popravte, obyčeje proměňte, zlá pokušenie přěmáhajte, hřiechóv dopuštěných pláčem mstěte; neb příchod věčného súdcě, tiem bezpečnější jsúce, uzříte, čím viece nynie ukrutnosti sě jeho bojiece připravujete.

May the merciful Savior, true God and true man, blessed forever, Jesus Christ, graciously bring about all these things for our salvation!
