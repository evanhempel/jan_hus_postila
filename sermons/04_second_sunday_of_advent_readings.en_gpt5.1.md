## Reading for the Second Sunday in Advent

St Luke writes in chapter 21, verses 25–33:

> At that time Jesus said:  
> “There will be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars,  
> and on the earth distress of peoples because of the roar of the sea and the surging,  
> so that people will wither away from fear  
> and from expectation of the things that are coming upon the whole world;  
> for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.  
> And then they will see the Son of Man  
> coming in a cloud with great power and glory.  
> And when these things begin to happen,  
> look up and lift up your heads,  
> because your redemption is drawing near.”  
>  
> And He told them a parable:  
> “Look at the fig tree and at all the trees.  
> When they already put forth fruit from themselves,  
> you know that summer is near.  
> So also you, when you see that these things are happening,  
> know that the kingdom of God is near.  
> Truly I say to you,  
> this generation will by no means pass away  
> until all these things take place.  
> Heaven and earth will pass away,  
> but My words will by no means pass away.”

Last Sunday we kept the memory of the coming of Christ who is humble and gentle;  
today’s reading shows Christ’s coming that is powerful and majestic.

Then it was said that the King came gentle and poor, riding on a little donkey.  
But today the reading says that they will see the Son of Man  
coming in a cloud with great power and glory.  
This is so that those who are not willing to love Him as humble and meek  
may at least fear Him as mighty and glorious.

So the memory of His first visitation serves to lift up our hope,  
and the memory of His second to keep us in holy fear.  
For Christians must have both hope and fear.  
Fear restrains them so that they do not quickly fall into sin,  
and hope holds them so that hardships do not overthrow them.

For Solomon says, Proverbs 1:32:  
> “The turning away of the little ones kills them,  
> and the success of fools destroys them.”

Therefore in today’s reading both fear is laid down and hope is shown.  
Fear, or terror, is set forth from the beginning of the reading  
up to the words, *“And when these things begin to happen,”*  
and then hope begins where it then says,  
*“Lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”*

Our Savior sets before us both fear and hope,  
and He shows the signs that will take place  
before His visitation on the Day of Judgment,  
which will come when He says, *“There will be signs in the sun and in the moon.”*  

Second, He sets before us His visitation, saying, *“Then they will see the Son of Man…”*  
Third, He sets forth the consolation of the righteous, saying,  
*“Lift up your heads.”*  
Fourth, He gives a warning to guard us from evil.

So this whole reading is given  
so that we may look carefully toward the final coming,  
the visitation, of Christ.

When, after Palm Sunday, on the Mount of Olives,  
the disciples asked Christ the Savior about the Day of Judgment, saying (Matthew 24:3):  
> “Tell us, when will these things be?  
> And what will be the sign of Your visitation and of the end of the world?”  

then among other things He answered them and said:  

> “There will be signs in the sun and in the moon…” and so on.

The Savior puts signs in heavenly things—  
in the sun, in the moon, in the stars—  
and also in earthly things—on the earth, in the sea, and in people,  
who will wither away with fear and dread.

He says: *“There will be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars.”*  
And what signs? He says in the reading of St Matthew 24:29:

> “The sun will be darkened,  
> the moon will not give its light,  
> and the stars will fall from heaven.”

The sun has already had a sign when it was darkened because of Christ’s death  
(Matthew 27:45),  
and likewise the moon at that time lost its light, as did the stars  
that receive their light from the sun.

But we can also understand it this way:  
the sun—Christ—will be darkened before the Day of Judgment,  
so that people will not see that Sun with living faith.  
And the moon, which means the community of Christians,  
will not give its light—  
that is, they will not shine with true teaching and good works.  
And the stars—that is, people—will fall from heaven,  
meaning that they will fall away from heavenly fellowship.

For the dragon Antichrist, as St John testifies in the Revelation (Apocalypse 12:4),  
with his tail will drag down a third part of the stars from heaven—  
not the stars that shine in the sky;  
those will neither fall nor be dragged down by the dragon,  
for they will remain there forever.  
Rather, people will fall away from heavenly things  
through the terror and craftiness of Antichrist  
and the deception of his messengers.

Christ foretold this when He first said to the disciples (Matthew 24:4–5, 24):

> “See that no one leads you astray.  
> For many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am Christ,’  
> and they will lead many astray.  
> …There will arise false prophets,  
> and they will give great signs and wonders,  
> so that, if it could be, even the chosen ones would be led into error.”

This is now being fulfilled very greatly.  
For the truth of Christ, and Christ Himself,  
now shine but little in people.  
They no longer even want Scripture to be read and Christ to be preached.  
Whomever they catch openly confessing the truth of Christ,  
him they curse, persecute, banish, execute, torture, imprison, and even kill.

As now in Moravia an official and others have starved a faithful man to death,  
and they have rotted the legs of the priest Martin, a preacher;  
and what was done in Prague last year,  
and what is now being done against those who bear Christ’s truth,  
is known to many people.  
All this comes from the messengers of Antichrist,  
the false preachers,  
who chase after money from the people  
for their own greed, pride, luxury, and fornication.  

They give forgiveness of sins for money,  
saying that the pope is the god of the earth  
who has power to give forgiveness of sins  
to whom he wants and when he wants.  
But they do not tell the people that Christ says (Luke 13:3):

> “Unless you repent of your sins, you will all perish.”

For they have so greatly darkened the truth, Christ,  
that preachers now name the pope more often than Christ,  
and they exalt and hold more firmly the ordinances of the pope  
than the law of our Lord Jesus Christ.  

Therefore His faithful sons are given over to suffering in many lands:  
in Bohemia, in Moravia, in Meissen, in England, and elsewhere there is great affliction,  
as I know from experience.  
They murder, torture, and curse faithful priests.  
And there is no need to go as far as Rome,  
for there is the peak of all the wickedness of Antichrist:  
pride, avarice, fornication, hypocrisy, and *svatokupectvie*  
(the buying and selling of holy things),  
so that from Rome all the way to Bohemia  
simony and greed have flowed out.

They sell and buy archbishoprics for a higher price  
than some lordships in Bohemia would cost,  
and they farm out indulgences for rent—  
however much any messenger of Antichrist can bring in,  
so that he can squeeze still more out of simple people.

And so people are withering away:  
some, fearing, dare not confess the truth against this error;  
others, because of the division among priests in preaching,  
do not know what they ought to hold to;  
still others are in great distress that so many go astray;  
and others endure insults, being branded heretics and murdered,  
and likewise suffer because of the great oppression of God’s truth.

For the sea is roaring—  
that is, the people of this world,  
who are compared to the sea.  
I say “roaring,”  
because they cry out that those who follow Christ  
and bear His truth are the ones who err and are heretics.  

And to this David adds (Psalm 93:4):

> “The liftings up of the sea are wonderful”—

that is, it is a strange and terrible thing  
how people have risen up against Christ and against the truth  
and have lifted up their voice;  
for again David says (Psalm 93:3):

> “The floods have lifted up their voice.”

So the signs are now already in the sun—Christ—  
for because of the growth of sins people no longer see Him with living faith.  
And there are signs in the moon—that is, in those who ought,  
having received the light of Scripture from Christ,  
to shine for others; these no longer shine.  
And there are signs in the stars,  
that those who ought, with longing, to cling to heavenly things  
have bent their desires toward earthly ways—  
especially those who ought to shine for others:  
the masters and prelates, that is, those set above others in spiritual office.  

Such learned men, who by their evil lives lead others into still worse evil,  
are falling away from eternal light.  
But on the other hand,  
those who teach others to live righteously, and live well themselves,  
will shine forever.

As the prophet Daniel says (12:3):

> “Those who are instructed will shine like the brightness of the sky,  
> and those who lead many to righteousness like stars forever and ever.”

See, here you have clearly that the prophet calls good learned men  
who teach others *stars*;  
and they have their light from the sun, Christ,  
who is the Sun of righteousness,  
as Malachias says (Malachi 4:2):

> “For you who fear My name  
> the Sun of righteousness will rise.”

But for false priests and preachers  
that Sun has gone down behind the mountain,  
as the prophet Micheas says (Micah 3:6):

> “The sun will go down over the prophets,  
> and the day will be dark over them.”

And just before that he says (Micah 3:5):

> “Thus says the Lord about the prophets  
> who lead My people astray,  
> who bite with their teeth and cry, ‘Peace,’  
> but whoever does not put something in their mouths,  
> against him they declare a holy war.”

Perhaps this Scripture touches those  
who proclaim a “crusade” against such as do not wish  
to be subjected to them in all things,  
and call it a *holy war*,  
a *holy fight*,  
giving forgiveness of sins and release from punishment  
to those who help in this war.

A strange thing indeed:  
they cannot free themselves from fleas and flies,  
yet they claim to free others from the pains of hell  
by their giving—  
without praying for it,  
or even living decent lives!

And if there is any faithful Christian  
who preaches against their wickedness,  
then they bear hatred toward him  
and, by invented tricks,  
they shut down the worship of God  
when they cannot otherwise stop the preaching  
that uncovers their evil to the people.

By such craft Antichrist most of all carries out his wickedness  
against the freedom and glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
About this craft I have written at length in other books,  
both in Czech and in Latin.  

It seems to me that this craft is the hardest and most painful  
for faithful Christians.  
For neither insults, nor torture, nor killing  
can stop the preaching of the truth  
by a faithful preacher of Christ who truly loves God.  
But this invented shutting down of the worship of God  
is a great assault,  
not only against the one who would gladly preach,  
but against the people who would gladly listen.

For what can trouble Christians more  
than to be denied burial, baptism, confession, the body of the Lord?  
Among such assaults the heaviest would be  
if they refused to baptize.  

But faithful and sensible Christians would defeat this:  
priests by not obeying such commands,  
and other people by not caring where they were buried,  
and by baptizing their children themselves in great need—  
and so, by God’s help, they would tear apart Antichrist’s nets  
with which, under the name of holy obedience,  
he cleverly deceives people.

This is that overwhelming tribulation  
of which the Savior says (Matthew 24:21–22):

> “Then there will be great tribulation,  
> such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now,  
> nor ever shall be.  
> And if those days were not shortened,  
> no human being would be saved;  
> but for the sake of the chosen of God those days will be shortened.”

Truly, the course of our present time  
gives the faithful understanding of that holy reading  
about the signs of the Day of Judgment,  
so that, noticing how things are going,  
they may weigh the words of their Savior,  
and, understanding, carefully prepare themselves  
against the craft of Antichrist.  
For after these signs the coming of the Son of God will not be delayed.

About that coming today’s reading says further that  
*“the powers of the heavens will be shaken”*—  
that is, the angels, as St Gregory says,  
will be stirred to come with the Son of Man  
to judgment against sinners.  

For Scripture says (Sapientia 5:18):

> “He will arm creation for vengeance on His enemies.”

Therefore the reading continues:  

> “And then they will see the Son of Man”—

that is, Jesus Christ,  
who is not the Son of two human parents,  
but of one human being, the Virgin Mary.

> “coming”—

that is, coming to judgment—

> “in a cloud”—

what sort of cloud that will be, He knows!—

> “with great power”—

that is, with great power against the proud sinners.  
For David the prophet says (Psalm 97:3):

> “Fire will go before Him  
> and will burn up His enemies round about.”

> “and with glory”—

that is, for the consolation of the righteous.  
For immediately after this He gives comfort to His own, saying:

> “And when these things begin to happen, look up”—

that is, with a pure heart look toward My help—

> “and lift up your heads”—

that is, your minds.  
As St Gregory says:  

> “To lift up the head is to lift up the mind  
> to the joy of the heavenly Father.”

For the Savior then adds:

> “because your redemption is drawing near”—

as if He were saying:  
“Now your deliverance will be,  
and the eternal condemnation of the wicked.”

Then the reading says:

> “And He told them a parable:  
> ‘Look at the fig tree and at all the trees…’”

and so on.  
The Savior gives His own a similar sign:  
just as, when fruit on the trees ripens,  
you know that summer is near,  
so when plagues and famines and wars and earthquakes  
and the signs already mentioned are in the world,  
then for the faithful the kingdom of God is near—  
that is, the blessedness they will have in heaven.

So the Savior says further:

> “So also you, when you see that these things are happening,  
> know that the kingdom of God is near.”

And He confirms this with an oath, saying:

> “Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away”—

that is, the human race will not pass from mortality into immortality—

> “until all these things”—

that is, the things already named—

> “take place.”

He proves it, saying:

> “Heaven and earth will pass away”—

that is, heaven will be changed and, after the Day of Judgment,  
will be more beautiful;  
and the earth too will be changed—

> “but My words will not pass away”—

that is, they will not be changed,  
but what I have meant by these words will always surely come to pass.

That, briefly, is about the reading.

Because the gracious Savior often spoke  
about His final coming, His last visitation,  
warning His faithful and declaring how dreadful it will be,  
we must carefully remember that coming,  
we must weigh it greatly,  
and we must live well.

For He will come to the wicked as a most dreadful Lord,  
so that the damned will say to the mountains (Hosea 10:8; Luke 23:30):

> “Fall on us!”

He will come—He who will not listen to any of the damned.  
He will come—He who will make known  
all the evils of every person  
to all the angels, people, and devils.  
He will come—He who will set all the damned ablaze  
with eternal fire.  
He will come—He who will condemn them  
to eternal fire and to darkness  
and to every kind of evil torment.

Therefore St Gregory says today in his sermon:

> “That day, most beloved brothers,  
> set before your eyes!”

And whatever now seems hard  
will then be light.  
For of that day the prophet says (Joel 2:31):

> “The Day of the Lord is near,  
> great and very dreadful.  
> And who can endure it?”

And the prophet Sophonias says in chapter 2:

> “The great Day of the Lord is near,  
> near and coming very quickly.  
> The sound of the Day of the Lord is bitter;  
> there the mighty will be troubled.  
> That day is a day of wrath,  
> a day of trouble and distress,  
> a day of ruin and desolation,  
> a day of darkness and gloom,  
> a day of cloud and storm,  
> a day of trumpet and battle cry.”

So writes Sophonias,  
showing that the Day of Judgment  
will be terribly fearful for the wicked.

Of it St Peter writes likewise (2 Peter 3:10–12):

> “The Day of the Lord will come like a thief,  
> in which the heavens will pass away with a great rushing,  
> and the elements, burning, will be demolished,  
> and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.  
> And since all these things are to be dissolved,  
> what sort of people ought we to be  
> in holy conduct and godliness,  
> waiting for and hastening the coming  
> of the Day of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
> through whom the heavens, being on fire, will be dissolved,  
> and the elements will melt with the heat of fire?”

So writes the chief apostle about the Day of Judgment—  
on that day when above us will be the Judge,  
offended by the wicked and angry with them;  
beneath us hell, dreadful and opened;  
on the right, all our sins openly accusing;  
on the left, the devils dragging into hell;  
around and behind, the world burning;  
before us, the angels driving into hell;  
within us, a conscience biting cruelly;  
without us, eternal fire burning our bodies;  
and all the saints confirming the sentence and saying with the Judge:

> “Depart, you cursed, into the eternal fire!”

O most dear ones,  
weighing such a heavy and dreadful coming of Christ  
and the Day of Judgment,  
let us carefully remember Christ’s first coming:  
that, having taken flesh,  
He came into the world in toil for our salvation.  

Let us be grateful,  
that He may now visit us spiritually by His grace  
and find us ready at our death.

Let us remember His dreadful last coming,  
so that we may be sentenced  
to the joy of heaven.  
For St Gregory says in today’s sermon:

> “That day, most beloved brothers,  
> remember with all your mind.  
> Set your life straight,  
> change your ways,  
> overcome evil temptations,  
> and avenge the sins already committed with tears.  
> For you will more safely see  
> the coming of the eternal Judge,  
> the more you now,  
> fearing His severity,  
> prepare yourselves.”

May the merciful Savior,  
true God and true man,  
Jesus Christ, blessed forever,  
in His mercy bring all this to pass for our salvation.
