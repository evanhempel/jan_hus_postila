title: Reading for the Second Sunday in Advent  
---

This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon for the Second Sunday in Advent, focusing on Christ's second coming as described in Luke 21:25-33. The sermon contrasts Christ's humble first coming with His glorious and powerful return, urging believers to heed the signs of the end times and live righteously.

- **Key themes**:
  1. **Signs of the End Times**:
     - Cosmic disturbances (sun, moon, stars) and earthly turmoil (wars, famines).
     - Moral decay, false prophets, and persecution of the faithful.
  2. **Christ's Return**:
     - He will come "in a cloud with power and great glory" (Luke 21:27).
     - A call to vigilance: "Lift up your heads, for your redemption draws near" (Luke 21:28).
  3. **Warning and Hope**:
     - Fear for the unrepentant, hope for the righteous.
     - Parable of the fig tree: Spiritual readiness is urgent (Luke 21:29-31).
  4. **Antichrist's Deception**:
     - False teachers corrupt the Church, prioritizing papal authority over Christ's truth.
     - Corruption (greed, hypocrisy) spreads from Rome to Bohemia and beyond.
  5. **Final Judgment**:
     - Christ will judge with divine wrath against sinners but bring eternal joy to the faithful.
     - Quotes from prophets (Joel, Zephaniah) and 2 Peter 3 emphasize the day's terror.
