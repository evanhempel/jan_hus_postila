# Sixth Sunday After Easter Night

From John 15:26–27 and 16:1–4.

At that time Jesus said: When the Comforter comes [new grace will visit you]—the Holy Spirit who comforts those in sorrow—whom I, true God, will send to you [as a gift] from the Father; the Spirit of truth [who is the eternal Truth and who loves the truth], who comes forth from the Father [by eternal begetting]—He will bear witness [by inward visitation] about Me [that I am God, and that My works are true]. And you also will bear witness [being taught by the Holy Spirit], because from the beginning [of My preaching] you have been with Me. I have told you these things so that you will not be offended [that is, so that you will not fall into impatience or deny the truth]. They will put you out of the synagogues [that is, cast you out of the community]; indeed, the hour is coming [that is, the time will come] when whoever kills you [that is, will be killing you] will think that he is offering service to God [that is, that by this he serves God]. And they will do these things to you [insults, excommunications, tortures, and killings], because they have not known [with true loving knowledge] the Father or Me [as God]. But I have said these things to you [about your sorrows and persecutions], so that when their hour comes [the time of those persecutions], you may remember them [those trials], and so suffer gladly, knowing that I, your Lord, who suffer first, have told you beforehand [so that you may bear them more easily].

**A.** Just before this reading, our gracious Savior told His disciples three things: first, that the world hates them; second, that the world will oppose them; and third, that the world will not keep their words—just as all three happened to Him.

Therefore, in this reading He promises them that the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, will come, who will comfort them and teach them the truth—the truth that the chosen sons of God will receive from them, and for whose sake the foreknown sons of the devil will oppose them.

Then He tells them of three evils that, if they bear them gladly, will turn to their salvation: first, that they will be hated; second, that they will be cast out; third, that they will be killed.

So He tells them in advance, first, so that they will not be offended, unwilling to suffer; second, so that, remembering He had foretold it, they would suffer gladly.

And because in this miserable world there are three great troubles: first, suffering, which torments a person; second, sin, which kills a person; and third, vanity, which deceives a person—therefore, against these three miseries the Savior promised to send His faithful ones the Holy Spirit, who is the Comforter of the sorrowful.

**B.** Christ says: “When the Comforter comes, whom I will send you from the Father”—that is against the first misery, suffering. “The Spirit of truth,” the Spirit who makes alive and revives the dead, as Christ says in John 6:63: “It is the Spirit who gives life”—that is against sin, which kills. When He says “of truth,” that is against vanity, which deceives a person with lies.

So the Holy Spirit comforts the sorrowful, lightens suffering, bears witness to the truth, rebukes deceitful delusions, and brings to life those who are dead in soul through sin; that, once revived, they might gladly suffer opposition for Christ, not let themselves be deceived by the world, and, living by grace, hurry toward their eternal dwelling.

Therefore the Savior says, “When He comes”—that is, when He visits you with new grace and gift—He does not move from place to place, for being God He is everywhere.

“The Comforter,” who comforts the sorrowful. “Whom I will send to you from the Father.” Here the Savior shows that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him and from the Father; for when He says, “whom I will send,” He means that the Spirit proceeds from Him. And by this Christ also shows that He Himself is true God; for only God can give and send the Holy Spirit, as has been proved before. Therefore, when Christ says, “whom I will send to you,” He is true God.

He says, “to you,” My disciples—for your comfort, your strengthening, and your instruction. “The Spirit of truth,” who is eternal Truth, always opposed to every lie. The Spirit “of truth,” because He loves the truth, teaches the truth, helps the truth, and finally sets the truth free.

“Who proceeds from the Father”—meaning, He has His being from the Father without beginning, for He is the eternal Spirit, as the Father and the Son are eternal.

“He will bear witness about Me”—by visiting you within and giving you special gifts. And so “you also,” enlightened and strengthened by the Holy Spirit, “will bear witness, because from the beginning” of My preaching and My working of miracles “you have been with Me.” All this was fulfilled, as they later said, as Luke writes in Acts 5:32: “We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit.”

**C.** Understand this: our dear Savior, living among the Jews, taught them wisely, did mighty miracles among them, and lived a virtuous life, giving them a good example.

John 15:24 says: “If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have seen and hated both Me and My Father.”

They opposed His wise teaching, saying He was mad, as they said, “He is out of His mind; why listen to Him?” (John 10:20). They opposed His mighty miracles, saying, as in Matthew 12:24, that He cast out demons by the power of the devil. They opposed His virtuous life, saying, as in John 9:24, “We know that this man is a sinner.”

So the disciples might have said: “Dear Lord and Master, You command us to bear witness about You among people who have thought You crazy, have attributed Your miracles to the devil’s power, and have called You, the Holy One, a sinner. What then can we do— we who are foolish, not so mighty, and sinners?”

And Christ would answer: “When the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you, He will teach you though you are foolish, give you power though you are weak, and shape your lives in virtue. But even when you have these, the wicked still will not listen to you; they will hate you, cast you out, and beat you.”

**D.** “And I have told you these things,” He says, “so that you will not be offended”—that is, not fall into impatience or deny the truth. “They will cast you out of the synagogues”—that is, they will excommunicate you, so they will not want to tolerate you in the community. That means cursing and public disgrace.

Here Saint Augustine says: The Jews did not want to be found in Christ; what else could they do but, being apart from Christ, cast out those who would not leave Christ? The same happens now: those who refuse to be in Christ by love and following Him—being adulterers, greedy, and otherwise wicked, and thus apart from Christ—cast out those who have not left Christ.

And they have now spread this excommunication so widely that, for a faithful Christian, it is often better to associate with someone excommunicated by them than with those who excommunicate others.

For we must avoid fellowship with the one whom God curses for open sin, as Paul says in 1 Corinthians 5:11: “If anyone who bears the name of brother”—that is, calls himself a Christian—“is guilty of sexual immorality, or greed, or is a thief, or a reviler, or an idolater, with such a one not even to eat.” And since those who excommunicate others are openly adulterers, greedy, simoniacs, robbers who tear from the poor even what they should have to eat, and revilers—speaking unrestrainedly and slandering innocent people in churches, taverns, and homes at the table—a faithful Christian must avoid their company and not eat with them. For there is little hope that such hardened people could be turned from their ways.

Therefore David, speaking in the person of a righteous man, says in Psalm 101:5: “Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, I will drive him away. And with one who is proud in eye and greedy in heart, I will not eat.”

And who slanders more at table than priests? And who has a more greedy heart—that is, insatiable desire? They would gladly gulp down all the wealth of the world, and still not satisfy their craving! For Scripture says in Ecclesiastes 5:10: “The one who loves money will not be satisfied with money.” And Aristotle, though a pagan, says that the desire for riches grows without end.

They are already blinded by their wickedness, as Solomon says in Wisdom 2:21: “Their own wickedness has blinded them,” so that when they curse faithful Christians, imprison and kill them, they think that in this they are serving God.

So Christ says: “The hour has come when everyone”—that is, such wicked people—“who kills you will think he is offering a service to God,” that is, serving God by that deed. The Savior says, “The hour has come,” not “will come,” so that the disciples would count it as surely as if it had already happened.

And it did happen, and it is happening today: the Jews, thinking they would serve God, killed God—but not His divinity—and murdered His disciples, while believing they were acting according to God’s law. As they said when they accused innocent Christ before Pilate (John 19:7): “We have a law, and according to that law He must die!”

Likewise, today’s priests, seizing a man who disturbs their greed and adultery, curse him, drive him out, imprison him, and cry that, according to their decrees, he must die—and not by an easy death, but by burning.

**E.** And why do they do this? Christ explains: “They will do these things”—that is, insults, excommunications, and murders—“because they have not known the Father or Me.” Understand: they have not truly known Him with loving knowledge. For every person in mortal sin does not know God.

This ignorance finds its nest especially in the highest teachers and priests, who, being prouder, greedier, and more immoral than others, think they know God best. They do not know God, though they say they are the ones appointed to explain God’s law and to have it in their hearts. But He who cannot lie says that “they will do these things to you because they have not known the Father or Me.”

And Isaiah 1:3 says: “The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master’s crib, but Israel does not know Me.”

The hardworking ox that plows the ground is the good priest, who breaks up human hearts with the plow of God’s Word, so that sins may be pulled up by the root. He sows the holy Word, which is the seed, as Christ says in Luke 8:11, into the soil—that is, into the heart—and presses out the chaff from the grain—that is, separates the truth from human inventions and from lies.

Such a priest is God’s ox, who knows his Master, the Lord Jesus. But priests who fatten themselves and care nothing for the salvation of souls—who neither plow nor haul anything into Christ’s barn—are fat oxen. To them the prophet Amos says in chapter 4:1–2: “Hear this word, you fat oxen who are on the mountain of Samaria, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who say to their lords, ‘Bring, that we may drink!’ The Lord has sworn by His holiness that behold, days are coming upon you when they shall take you away with hooks, and the rest of you with boiling pots!”

Thus speaks that shepherd Amos, prophesying to the fat oxen—priests who sit on the mountain of Samaria, that is, on the watchtower; for *Samaria* means “watch.” Priests are supposed to keep high watch over the people, so that the devil does not steal or destroy them. But instead they oppress, squeeze, and afflict the poor—on one side forcing them to give tithes and offerings for baptism, confession, sacraments, and other spiritual things; on another side taking for themselves whatever good people would give to the poor; and further oppressing with deceitful indulgences, and especially by wasting and hoarding the property they receive.

For what priests hold beyond what is truly necessary for decent clothing and sufficient support—according to what they would need to lead God’s people to salvation—belongs to the poor. And these fat oxen say to their lords—that is, to the laypeople who are lords over property and also set over priests for protection—“Bring us drink!”

How many times a day, without need, do they bring drink to these gluttons, pouring continually whenever they want, and sometimes even when they don’t want more, and they still drink! A four-footed ox would not do that.

But their time is coming, for Amos says that God has sworn by His Holy One—that is, by His own name, and thus by Himself—that the days will come upon those oxen when they will be lifted up on hooks—that is, their flesh will be chopped for eating—and “the rest of you in boiling pots.” Their bodies will be eaten by worms, and devils will seize their souls and torment them without their bodies until Judgment Day, and after that with their bodies as well.

Then, the donkey that knows its master is the layperson who keeps God’s commandments and, like a donkey, patiently bears whatever penance the priest lays on him. Thus the donkey with the ox have known their Lord and Master. But “Israel,” God says in Isaiah 1:3, “has not known Me.” Many among the Jewish people did not know Christ, and especially the priests and scribes.

Likewise, in our time, those who ought to be the spiritual “Israel”—that is, those who see God by living faith—do not know Him. I mean those who live in sin; they do not know God. Of them Christ now says: “They have not known the Father or Me.”

“And I have said these things to you”—about your sorrows and persecutions—“so that when their hour comes”—the time of those persecutions—“you may remember them and so suffer gladly, knowing that I, your Lord, who suffer first, have told you beforehand,” that you may bear them more easily and have joy in that certainty.

**F.** Because in this reading the Savior speaks of being “cast out,” telling His disciples they will be excommunicated for carrying His truth, and that those who do not know the Father or Christ will do this, it is good to lay out briefly and clearly what excommunication is.

Know that excommunication is being driven out of the community and is called a curse. It can be either evil or good.

It is evil when they drive a good, innocent person out of the community so that no one will associate with him. Thus Christ was excommunicated by the Jews through the authority of their bishops, priests, and scribes, as John 9:22 says: “The Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus to be the Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.” And in this reading Christ tells His disciples that the same excommunication awaits them.

But excommunication can also be good in three ways, and so can a curse.

First, when God Himself, because of mortal sin, casts a person out of the holy community, so that for that time he has no share in God’s grace or in the benefits of the holy Church. In mortal sin a person is separated from God and from the holy Church and becomes an empty house in which the devil dwells. So every person—and every devil—who is in mortal sin is under God’s curse, as David says to God in Psalm 119:21: “You rebuke the arrogant, who are cursed, who wander from Your commandments.”

We priests say this at every Mass. So every priest who is in mortal sin and still mutters these words is, in fact, confessing God’s curse upon himself and cursing himself. And all priests, by saying this, declare cursed every mortal sinner—whether already in hell or still alive here in this world. And all the saints in heaven agree that this curse is true and that this is the real excommunication. Yet wicked priests and other evil people make very little of this curse.

Second, excommunication can be good when done rightly by a spiritual ruler, such as a priest, or by a temporal ruler, such as a lord or town council, when they cast someone out of the community because of open sin.

But a priest must act one way, and a secular ruler or community another. The highest Bishop entrusted the spiritual procedure to priests when He said to Peter—and in him to the whole Church—in Matthew 18:15–17: “If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. If he does not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as a pagan and a notorious sinner.”

Here is clearly laid out how excommunication—what we now call a curse—is to proceed: first, it must be for mortal sin; second, for the brother’s gain unto salvation; third, it must come from love.

That it must be for sin, Christ shows when He says, “If your brother sins”—meaning, sins mortally, for a venial sin does not separate a person from God or from the holy community, nor does it make him cursed. So no one should be cursed or excommunicated except for mortal sin, as both Scripture and papal decrees teach.

Nor should the pope or bishop excommunicate for every mortal sin; not for hidden sins at all, and not immediately even for public sins. There must first be three admonitions, as Christ commanded Peter: first, go to him and rebuke him alone, that he may leave his sin. If he will not, then, second, take one or two more and rebuke him with them. Third, tell it to the church. And if he will not listen to the church, then you must avoid him and not associate with him, just as with a pagan or notorious sinner.

From this the saints concluded that no one should be excommunicated or publicly declared wicked unless he has rejected these three admonitions and refuses to leave his mortal sin.

Such excommunication is like spiritual medicine. It must not be deadly—that is, for damnation—but for salvation; and also so that he does not corrupt others. For one diseased sheep infects the rest; one diseased limb harms the whole body; a little leaven leavens—or spoils—the whole batch of dough.

For this reason Christ says in Matthew 18:8: “If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you.” And Paul writes to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 5) that they had a notorious adulterer among them and tolerated it, not realizing that a little leaven leavens the whole lump. So he ordered that man to be excommunicated and handed over to Satan, so that his spirit might be saved.

For, as Saint Augustine says, holy Paul had power to hand over notorious sinners to the devil, so that the devil tormented them in the body but did not harm their souls. Seeing such punishment, they repented, and others did not dare to sin openly. That power popes, bishops, and other prelates no longer have; for, as *S. Jan Zlatoústý* (John Chrysostom) says on *Ep. ad Hebr.*, having grasped after wealth, they have surrendered that power and no longer have it.

So you see: only for mortal sin, and only after three admonitions in the order I described, may a prelate excommunicate or curse.

From this you can reason that whenever they curse someone who is guilty of no mortal sin, they do him wrong, and in truth God reckons that curse as a blessing. Therefore David says in the person of a righteous man (Psalm 109:28): “They may curse, but You will bless.” That is: they will call him evil, but You, Lord God, will call him good.

Christ Himself confirmed this when He said to His faithful ones in Matthew 5:11–12: “Blessed are you when people curse you, and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely because of Me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven.”

You also see from this that God does not confirm every priestly or prelatical curse, and that many are excommunicated by priests but are not excommunicated by God nor cast out of the holy Church, as say Augustine, Origen, and the master of the *Sentences*.

Again, you see that if every priest in the world cursed and excommunicated a person who has no mortal sin, they would all be mistaken. If he bears it gladly, the curse and excommunication will not harm him, but rather greatly benefit him. For the Savior says in Matthew 5:11: “Blessed are you when people curse you.”

And as a sign of this: when the bishops and priests cast out that blind man whom Christ had healed, the gracious Savior immediately found him, spoke with him, and confirmed him in faith, as John 9:22 and following relate.

So many priests cast people out and Christ receives them. And I trust in His holy grace that He has received me, though they have cast me out, because against their will I preach His holy Word.

**G.** Now, that a priestly curse or excommunication must be done in love, the Savior shows when He says to Peter in Matthew 18:15, “If your brother sins.” By calling him “brother,” He means that he is to be rebuked and, if necessary, excommunicated from brotherly love.

And Paul says in 1 Corinthians 16:14: “Let all that you do be done in love.” That is: whatever you do, do everything in love.

This is easy to see by an example. Suppose there is a man in the kingdom gravely ill in body, whom the whole kingdom should pity and desire to see restored to health because the kingdom would benefit from it; especially his brothers should be eager to help him recover if they can. In the same way, when a man is in mortal sin, all the kingdom of Christ—that is, the congregation of faithful Christians—ought to pity a soul wounded unto death and ask God to heal him and restore him to serve the holy Church, especially because they are brothers with one Father, the Lord Jesus.

Therefore, when a man is excommunicated, priests ought to speak to the people with sorrow and urge them to pray God for that man, that God would give him understanding to leave his sin. But they do the opposite: they hand him over to devils and desire that they tear his soul from his chest and carry it to hell! They act falsely in this, just as they excommunicate falsely.

And most often they desire this for those who rebuke their sins, or who do not pay them tithes, or who in some way cross their interests. Being commanded by their Redeemer to pray for such people, they act backward.

God says in Matthew 5:44: “Pray for those who persecute you and slander you.” Instead, they abuse them and slander them. They should thank those who rebuke their sins, yet they revile them—just as the Jews reviled the Lord Jesus, and as a mad patient rages against his faithful physician.

So these poor souls, thinking they harm others, only harm themselves. Therefore Saint Gregory warns them: the shepherd—that is, the spiritual prelate—must fear lest he bind or loose without due care; lest he bind—that is, curse and excommunicate—wrongly. He must fear, for if he curses falsely, he sins gravely and curses himself.

**H.** A priest curses falsely, first, when he curses more for bodily gain than for salvation. Second, he curses falsely when he curses for his own honor or glory, for he must not seek his own praise in this. Third, he curses falsely when he does it for personal revenge. Fourth, when he curses without following the order Christ gave—when he curses without first admonishing his brother to leave his sin. Fifth, when he curses a man while knowing that man is not guilty of mortal sin. This fifth is the gravest of these five sins.

When a person looks with inner eyes upon present-day curses, he finds that, generally, those who curse others stand under God’s curse. No one ought to curse another unless he himself is free from mortal sin. As has already been said, whatever a person does he must do in love, and so without mortal sin; for love will not dwell with mortal sin in the soul.

The Lord Jesus gave examples of this. In Luke 4:23 He says, “Physician, heal yourself!” And again, when the scribes, priests, and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery and said (John 8:4–9): “Teacher, this woman has been caught in adultery. Now Moses commanded us to stone such women. What do You say?” the merciful Savior stooped down and wrote with His finger on the ground. When they kept on asking Him, He stood up and said: “Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to cast a stone at her.” And they went away one by one, and did not condemn her.

The saints say: whoever wants to judge another for sin must first see that he himself does not grind that same sin in his own soul—especially the very sin for which he wishes to judge another.

Again, the Savior says in Matthew 7:5: “Hypocrite, first take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to say, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck from your eye.’” The beam in the eye is great sin in desire; the speck is a smaller one.

Therefore priests—and first of all popes and bishops—if they want to curse others, must first themselves be free from mortal sin; they must first cast out of their own desires the beams of simony, greed, pride, adultery, and other sins.

O merciful Savior, if You would now write with Your finger so that everyone who judges another might see his own sins and be as confounded as those who wanted to condemn the adulterous woman, then few, whether clergy or laity, would dare to curse or condemn others!

Third, a curse or excommunication can be good—and this will be on the Day of Judgment—when the highest Priest and King commands His angels to separate the wicked from the good and He Himself proclaims the curse on them, saying, as in Matthew 25:41: “Depart from Me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels!”

Then we will know who is a stinking goat and who is an innocent sheep; who is blessed and who is cursed.

Gracious Savior, here on earth let them curse, chase, drive, and strike; here let them beat and cut. Only, on that Day do not cast Your curse on me, a sinner, nor on others who are Your chosen sons. Rather, give us blessing, saying, as in Matthew 25:34: “Come, you who are blessed by My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you.” Amen.

**I.** But know this also: they have a covering for their false curses. They say that every curse, both just and unjust, binds a person. This is a gross lie. For when they curse and excommunicate someone falsely, yet the righteous God blesses and looses that person and holds him by grace as His living member—how could that person be at the same time cursed, bound, and excommunicated? It is impossible. Otherwise their curse would have to be stronger than God’s blessing, and God would be unjust in helping them do such wrong to His faithful servant.

Therefore the prophet Bálam understood this when he rode out, for the sake of gifts, to the pagan king Balák to curse the people of Israel—that is, the Jews. Balák said to him: “Come, curse Jacob; hurry and defile Israel.” Bálam answered: “How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? Why should I defame him whom the Lord has not defamed?” Later he says further: “Stand here, Balák, and listen, son of Zippor: God is not a man that He should lie, nor a son of man that He should change His mind. Has He said, and will He not do it? Or has He spoken, and will He not fulfill it? I have been summoned to bless; I cannot revoke the blessing. There is no idol in Jacob, nor is there seen any idol in Israel. The Lord his God is with him.” (All this is in Numbers 23:7–8, 18–21.)

Here you have clear Scripture, against which none can speak unless he chooses the side of heresy. From it you have: first, that a person truly cannot curse one whom God blesses; second, that God cannot lie; third, that He cannot change—in His divine nature; fourth, that Bálam could not curse or defame the Jewish people, because God blessed them; and he gives the reason: because there was no sin of idolatry among them.

Seeing this by God’s Spirit, Bálam looked from afar upon the people, blessed them, and said (Numbers 23:10): “Let my soul die the death of the righteous, and let my final end be like theirs!”

O that the unbelieving ravens would learn from this Scripture!

**K.** They have yet another trick by which they try to frighten everyone they curse. They say that even a false curse from one’s pastor must be feared, for Saint Gregory says: “Let the one who is under the hand of the shepherd fear to be bound, even unjustly; and let him not rashly attack the judgment of his shepherd.”

Understand this: when a person is sure he is not guilty, he need not fear that a false curse will harm his soul. It is impossible for anyone to harm a person’s soul unless that person harms his own soul by sin, as Saint John Chrysostom demonstrates beautifully.

For Peter says in 1 Peter 3:13–14: “Who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good? But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you are blessed.”

And the merciful Savior Himself says in Luke 6:22–23: “Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you and insult you and cast out your name as evil on account of the Son of Man. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven!”

Here is enough Scripture for a faithful servant of God, unjustly cursed, to know that such a curse does not harm but rather benefits his soul. Elsewhere I have gathered many more texts about this.

But why, then, according to Saint Gregory, should one “fear” a curse? Know that, first, he should fear so that he does not fall into pride, impatience, and thus into arrogance, as Gregory himself also says. Second, he should fear for the harm of his pastor—that his pastor, by cursing unjustly, not damage his own soul. For by falsely cursing his subject, he wrongs God, his neighbor, and himself, and so harms himself.

Third, he should fear for the harm that may come to his neighbors through that curse—for example, that they might, out of ignorance, avoid the cursed man’s preaching of God’s Word, or withhold spiritual help from him, such as baptism, confession, or burial. This they often do when priests fight over benefices, and they did so especially when I began to preach.

Though they well knew I had been in Prague from Christmas until after Easter and had served there, once I began to preach they immediately stopped the services—those men to whom hearing God’s Word is heavy. And truly, when such enemies of the Word of God are not worthy to serve—being simoniacs, greedy, and adulterers—it would be a hundred times better, and less harmful, if they did not serve at all. For by serving, they only serve to their own damnation.

May God keep us from that damnation through the merits of our Lord Jesus Christ! Amen.
