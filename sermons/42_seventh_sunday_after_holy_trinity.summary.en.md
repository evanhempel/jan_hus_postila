---

This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon for the Seventh Sunday After Holy Trinity, based on Mark chapter 8, verses 1-9. Hus reflects on Jesus feeding the 4,000 and draws spiritual lessons for church leaders and believers.  

**Key Points**
- Jan Hus emphasizes Jesus' dual nature as both divine and human:  
  - Divine: Jesus miraculously fed thousands with seven loaves and a few fish  
  - Human: Jesus physically interacted with people and showed compassion  
- Key lessons for church and secular leaders:  
  1. Seek counsel before making decisions, as Jesus consulted his disciples  
  2. Show mercy by providing for the needs of the people, especially the poor  
  3. Gather leftovers to ensure nothing is wasted and give to the needy  
- Spiritual teachings for believers:  
  - Clergy should diligently teach God's Word to guide people toward eternal joy  
  - People must repent of sin, turn to God, and be nourished by His Word to avoid spiritual death  
- Jan Hus criticizes those who prioritize feeding animals over caring for the poor, calling it a sign of misplaced priorities  
- He highlights the importance of feeding those who return from "far away" (spiritual distance caused by sin) with spiritual food  

**Key Quote**
> *"Let the merciful Savior grant that those who are far away, i.e., from great sins, do not perish; and that those who have not yet come to Jesus may return and partake of His spiritual bread."*
