# Third Sunday After Easter Night  
John 16:16–22

“Jesus said to his disciples: ‘In a little while, and you will no longer see me; and again, in a little while, you will see me, because I am going to the Father.’

Then his disciples said to one another, ‘What is this he is telling us: “In a little while, and you will not see me, and again in a little while, and you will see me,” and “because I am going to the Father”?’ So they kept asking, ‘What is this “little while” that he says? We do not understand what he is talking about.’

Jesus knew they wanted to question him, so he said to them, ‘You are discussing among yourselves what I meant when I said, “In a little while, and you will not see me; and again, in a little while, and you will see me, because I am going to the Father.” Amen, amen—*by my divinity and by my humanity*—I tell you: you will weep in your spirits and you will cry with your eyes, but the world will rejoice. You will be in sorrow, but your sorrow will turn into joy.

When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow, because her hour has come; but when she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers the pain, because of her joy that a human being has been born into the world. So you also have sorrow now, because my hour has come that I must suffer; but I will see you again when I rise from the dead, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.’”

From many Gospel readings you already know what the merciful Savior spoke at his last supper: how he comforted his disciples about the sorrow that was coming, the sorrow that would fall on them because of his passion and death. In this reading he does the same. He tells them both of their coming sorrow and of the joy that will follow.

He says: “In a little while”—that is, in three days—it is already drawing near that “you will no longer see me. And again, in a little while”—that is, after those three days, through forty days until the Ascension—“you will see me.”

And it happened exactly so. In that night, and on Friday, and on Saturday, and the night before Sunday, during that short time, they did not see him. But after he rose from the dead, in that short period until he ascended into heaven, they saw him ten times. During that time they were already filled with joy and were made firm again in the faith in which they had doubted.

Because this was the way Christ was appointed to go to the Father—first through suffering and crucifixion, then through rising and ascending into heaven, as it had been ordained from eternity by the holy Trinity—he says, “I am going to the Father.”

“I go,” he means, “through being crucified, and for that you will be in sorrow. And in a little while—that is, for three days—you will not see me. And again, in a little while—that is, for forty days, until I ascend after rising from the dead—you will see me, for according to this order given by the Father, I am going to the Father.”

But this “little while” can also be understood in a deeper way.

That first “little while” can stand for the whole time of the sons of God, the elect, while they live in this world. During this life, they see Christ only by faith. And if we compare this seeing by faith with the clear seeing of Christ in the joy of heaven, then this faith-seeing is almost like not seeing at all.

And the time we spend here is truly very short compared to God’s eternity. No one has ever lived in this world for a full thousand years, though some have come close. And holy David says to God in Psalm 90:4: “A thousand years in your sight are like yesterday’s day, which has already passed.”

After this time, in which the elect do not see God clearly, there comes a very short moment at death. In that moment the elect receive like a spark of clear knowledge of the joy of heaven. That is the beginning and the down payment of that joy.

And in that very little moment, while still leaving this world, the elect receive a hundred times more than whatever they have given up for Christ. As *sanctus Marcus* writes in chapter 10, verses 29–30, Christ said: “Amen, I tell you, there is no one who leaves house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or fields for me and for my teaching, who will not receive a hundred times as much now in this time, and in the age to come, eternal life.”

O, which chosen son of God, when at the hour of death he sees the joy of heaven, does not count the heavenly Father a hundred times more precious than any earthly father, and the brothers and sisters in that heavenly joy more than any family on earth, and the kingdom of heaven more than all his fields?

And because Christ is going to the Father to prepare a place of eternal blessedness for his faithful servants, it is certain there will be a third “time”—that eternal day—when the joy of the elect will be brought to completion. Whoever truly values that joy in his heart gladly endures every struggle in this miserable world, just to reach that joy.

The reading then says the disciples did not understand Christ’s words. They were too full of sorrow. They believed he was about to be seized and that they would all be separated from the company of their beloved Master.

They also did not understand because his saying sounded to them self‑contradictory: “In a little while and you will not see me, and again in a little while and you will see me.” So they said twice, “We do not know what he is talking about.”

Jesus, knowing they wanted to question him, stepped ahead of them—as he always does in every good thing with his faithful servants—and he gave them understanding.

He explains that in that first “little while,” that short time marked by the word “little,” the disciples will “weep and cry,” because during that time he will be taken away from them by his passion and death. And “the world”—that is, the Jews, who at that time were “the world that does not know me”—will rejoice, thinking they have finally extinguished Christ, whom they judged to be their greatest enemy and a blaspheming heretic.

And because this had to happen without fail, Christ strengthens it with a double oath, saying: “Amen, amen”—by my divinity, amen; and by my humanity, amen—“I tell you that you will weep in your spirits and cry with your eyes, and the world”—that is, the Jews, who are ‘the world’ that does not know me and does not want to receive me—“will rejoice.”

And notice this: “the world,” meaning the evil people in the world, and Christ’s faithful disciples are always opposed to each other. The wicked cannot truly share in the joy of the good, and the good do not join in the evil joy of the wicked. And because here in this life the wicked have their rejoicing, the Savior adds: “But your sorrow will turn into joy.”

Why will it turn? Because God always leads his own people into better and better things, while the devil always drives his people into worse and worse things, pressing them down like into mud and a deep pit.

And it happened exactly as Christ said. After his resurrection, when the disciples saw the Lord, they rejoiced. And their joy kept growing, step by step, until they came to the full and perfect joy of heaven.

To help his still‑slow disciples understand, the Savior gives them a common example: “A woman, when she is giving birth, has sorrow, because her hour has come. But when she has given birth to the child, the pain is over, because a long joy follows after a short pain. She no longer remembers the anguish, because of her joy that a human being has been born into the world.”

In a spiritual sense, this woman can stand as a picture of Christ’s humanity. Christ’s human nature suffered a very heavy pain in giving birth to the spiritual race of mankind—that is, to the whole assembly of the elect who are to be saved—and it did so very painfully.

They stretched his limbs in different directions on the cross, they pierced his hands and his feet, they opened his side. He was thirsty, like a woman in labor who sometimes thirsts greatly. And then they gave him gall and vinegar mixed with myrrh to drink.

He also wept greatly on the cross, asking God the Father for this child that he was bringing forth with such great pain. And he cried out with a louder voice than any woman in labor. He cried out in his pain: “O all you who pass by the way, look and see: is there any pain like my pain?”

And so, as *sanctus Augustinus* says, just as Eve came out of Adam’s side, so the holy church came out of Christ’s side. Eve was formed physically from his rib, but the holy church was spiritually born from the blood of Christ that flowed from his side.

And although Christ’s humanity died, yet as God he did not die. Therefore, on the third day after that great suffering, that “woman”—that is, Christ’s human nature—revived, now rejoicing that the pain was past, and that she had brought forth “the man”: the holy church, the assembly of the elect for salvation.

And do not think it strange that Christ’s humanity can be called a “woman.” For he himself calls every person who does the will of his Father his sister and his mother. As he says in Matthew 12:50: “Whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, that person is my brother, and my sister, and my mother.”

Also, in the Gospel reading Christ is often called “the kingdom of heaven,” which is the whole assembly of the elect. And so *sanctus Augustinus* often says that since Christ is the head of the holy church, Christ with his members together is the one holy church.

And because the disciples are his members and must suffer together with him, he says to them: “Therefore”—because my hour has come to suffer like a woman in labor—“you also have sorrow now. But I will see you again when I rise from the dead, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.”

Know this: the disciples’ sorrow did not last beyond three days. On the third day the news of Christ’s resurrection had already reached them, and that very day he saw them, and they saw him, full of joy.

That day he calmed their sorrow and began in them a joy that he kept increasing firmly all the way until his Ascension and until their own deaths. And after their deaths, in the kingdom of heaven, he brought that joy to completion.

No one could take that joy away from them—just as no one could ever break the eternal love in God with which he had chosen them.

Therefore *Beda* says: “No one took their joy from them. For even though afterward they suffered many troubles, yet in the hope of the resurrection and inflamed by the sight of Christ, they counted it all joy whenever they fell into adversity.”

And following this, the apostle James teaches others to do the same. In chapter 1, verse 2, he says: “Count it all joy, my brothers, when you fall into various trials”—that is, when you fall into different adversities.

The apostles themselves did this. As *sanctus Lucas* writes in the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 5, verse 41: “The apostles left the council”—that is, the Jewish council—“rejoicing that they had been counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name of Jesus Christ,” after they had been beaten.

Notice three things in the Savior’s words about this joy.

First: this joy comes *after* sorrow. Therefore it will be sweeter and greater. In the same way, the sorrow that comes *after* the joy of this world will be all the greater and heavier.

Second: this joy is a joy of the heart. Christ says: “Your *heart* will rejoice.” It is not just laughter on the face; it is deep joy inside.

Third: this joy will be eternal. Christ says: “No one will take your joy away from you.”

May dear Christ, by his mercy, help us to reach that joy after the misery of this world. Amen.
