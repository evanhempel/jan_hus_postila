Jan Hus delivers a sermon on Matthew chapter 5, verses 20-24, focusing on the necessity of exceeding the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. The sermon emphasizes love for one's neighbor, the dangers of anger, and the importance of reconciliation before offering gifts to God.

### Key Points:
- **Righteousness** must surpass that of scribes and Pharisees to enter Heaven.
- **Anger and Insults**:
  - Unrighteous anger makes one deserving of judgment.
  - Calling someone "Raca" (fool) makes one worthy of condemnation.
  - Calling someone "moron" makes one deserving of hellfire.
- **Reconciliation Before Worship**:
  - If a brother has something against you, leave your gift at the altar and reconcile first.
- **Hypocrisy of Religious Leaders**:
  - The scribes and Pharisees acted righteous outwardly but failed inwardly.
- **Justice**:
  - True justice involves loving God and neighbors, avoiding murder, anger, and insults.
- **Three Levels of Sin**:
  1. Anger in the heart.
  2. Showing anger outwardly.
  3. Expressing anger verbally or in writing.
- **Three Levels of Judgment**:
  1. Earthly judgment.
  2. Eternal condemnation.
  3. Hellfire.
- **True Sacrifice**:
  - Sacrifice to God is meaningless without reconciliation and love.

### Key Quote:
> "But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire." (Matthew 5:22)
