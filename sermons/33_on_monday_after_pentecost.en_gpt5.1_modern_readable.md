# On Monday After Pentecost

From St. John, chapter 3, verses 16–21.

At that time Jesus said: “For God (the Father) loved the world (that is, the assembly of his chosen people) so much that he gave his Son (not a servant, not someone else’s) — his only-begotten Son (not one among many) — and he gave him freely (not as a loan), so that everyone who believes in him (that is, who with heartfelt love holds fast to him always) — in him the Son, and so also in the Father and in the Holy Spirit — will not perish (not be lost forever, in soul or in body), but will have eternal life (that is, will live forever in everlasting joy). For God did not send his Son into the world (that is, onto the earth among people) to judge the world (to condemn the assembly of his chosen people), but so that the world (the assembly of the elect) might be saved (that is, made eternally blessed) through him. Whoever believes in him (that is, holds fast to him by the grace of God’s Son, all the way to the end) is not judged (the Father and the Son do not judge him for condemnation). But whoever does not believe (does not hold fast to him by grace to the end) is already judged, because he does not believe in the name of the only-begotten Son of God (that is, in Jesus the Savior). And this is the judgment: that the light (the Son of God) came (by incarnation) into the world (among people), and people loved darkness (sins) more than the light (truth and virtues), because their works were evil. For everyone who does evil (like an adulterer, a thief) hates the light and does not come to the light, so that his works will not be punished when they are seen. But whoever does what is true (practices virtue, does good) comes to the light, so that his works may be revealed as having been done in God.”

Our gracious Savior spoke this holy reading as he was teaching Nicodemus, who had come to him by night, why the Son of Man — that is, Christ himself — had to be lifted up on the cross, just as the serpent was lifted up on a pole in the wilderness.

In this reading I notice three things.

First, a mighty strengthening of our hope and faith, because the Son of God says: “Whoever believes will not perish.”

Second, a sure confirmation of the goodness of God, because the Savior says: “God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son” — that is, he gave him unto death for the world.

Third, I notice the evil of humankind, for the Savior says that “people loved darkness more than the light.”

He begins by saying: “For God” — that is, very greatly — “loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son,” that is, he gave him over to death.

To understand this better, know that in Scripture the word *world* is used in different ways.

When Scripture says in Acts 17:24: “God made the world,” there *world* means all created things together.

When Scripture says in 1 Timothy 1:15 that the Son of God came into the world, *world* there means the earth, which is in the universe, where people live.

When Scripture says in John 1:10, “and the world did not know him,” *world* there means wicked people.

Again, when Christ says in John 17:9, “Father, I pray for them (that is, for the elect), not for the world,” there *world* means the damned.

But here, when the Savior says: “God so loved the world,” and again: “that he did not send his Son to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved,” in these three sayings *world* means the chosen people who are to be saved. For that world God has loved very greatly from eternity; for that world he gave his Son; and that world he does not judge for condemnation, but rather he saves that world.

About this he says: “God so loved the world that he gave…”

So let us weigh it: Who did this? What did he do? Through whom? For whom? Why? And how did he do it?

Who? Almighty God, who needs no one’s help; supremely wise, who needs no counselor; supremely good, who needs no one else’s goodness, but from his own goodness lets all creation share in good things.

“He so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.” There you have who did it: God. And how? He “so loved” — that is, he loved exceedingly — that he joined the immeasurable, immortal God, who could not suffer, with our humanity, so that he became a small, mortal man, able to suffer; he chose a person corrupted by sin to become his child; and this one natural Lord, his only Son, he gave over to the most shameful and the most cruel death.

The apostle Paul weighed this. Therefore he says in Romans 5:8: “God shows his love for us in this: that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” And why? Because Christ himself says: “God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son.” God so loved the world that he did not spare his own special Son — that is, he did not leave him without death, but gave him up for us all, as Romans 8:32 says — that is, he gave him up to death.

So now we have *how* he did it. And *what* did he do? He gave his Son. It would already be a great thing if someone sent servants to die; but he gave his Son. And not one son chosen from many, but his only one — and not taken from among the elect, but his only-begotten; and he did not give some lowly slave, but one who is God, equal to himself. And he did this powerfully, graciously, wisely, and with immeasurable goodness.

Let us also weigh: *through whom* did he do this? Through the Son, through whom all things were made and without whom nothing can exist.

And *for whom* did he do it? For the world — for an assembly of unclean people, corrupted by sin.

O unclean world, consider this: the One who could never become unclean was given for you, to cleanse you, to redeem you from condemnation, and to bring you to eternal life. And then you will understand why God gave his Son over to death: so that you, O world, would be redeemed from the death of sin and from the death of eternal damnation. For the Redeemer of the world says: “God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.”

Let us think on this: God, the supreme goodness, loved the world so greatly — that is, he loved *us sinners* so greatly — that he gave, not sold, something so good. For nothing can be so good as God. He gave without any need of his own, and without anything we had earned, that God might become man. He gave his Son, not to feasts and honors, but into great labor and humiliation, and then to a cruel death.

Why?

The Son who was given tells us: “So that everyone” — that is, every person — “who believes,” that is, who with heartfelt love always holds fast to him until death, “will not perish,” that is, will not be eternally condemned, “but will have eternal life,” that is, will live in joy forever.

So then, O world, remember: God gave his Son for you. You, in return, give him your will. He has forgiven your sins; now you do good to your own soul. Have pity on yourself. Do not harm yourself, so that you may have eternal life. Behold, he gave his life unto death; you put to death in yourself the death of sin and receive eternal life.

For the Savior goes on to say that “God did not send his Son into the world” — that is, onto the earth among people — “to judge” — that is, to condemn forever — “the world,” that is, the assembly of the elect who will be saved, “but so that the world might be saved through him.”

Here Saint Augustine says: Why is he called the Savior of the world? Only so that he might save the world. Then, as far as the Physician is concerned, he has come to heal the sick. The one who refuses to keep the Physician’s instructions kills himself. Therefore, if you will not keep the commands of this Physician, you condemn yourself.

Listen to what he says next: “Whoever believes in him” — that is, whoever holds fast to him with heartfelt love until death — “is not judged,” that is, the Father and the Son do not judge him for condemnation.

Here you should know that in Latin it says: *non judicatur*. And I cannot explain that single Latin word into Czech with just one word that keeps the same exact sense.

If I translated *non judicatur* as “he is not being judged,” that phrase in Czech would tend toward a different meaning. If I said “he is not judged,” that would be *non est judicatus*. And if I said “he will not be judged,” that would be *non erit judicatus*. So it seemed better to me to say, “whoever believes, nesúdie ho — they do not judge him.” But if someone sees a better way, or offers a sounder explanation, thanks be to God — I gladly accept it.

The Savior continues: “But whoever does not believe” — that is, whoever does not hold fast to him with heartfelt grace all the way to the end — “is already judged,” that is, already condemned by the Father and by the Son and by the Holy Spirit, even though that sentence has not yet been publicly announced to the people.

And why is he already condemned? For this one reason: he does not have faith adorned with love. Therefore the Savior says that he is already condemned “because he does not believe in the name of the only-begotten Son of God,” that is, in Jesus the Savior.

Know this: a person will not be condemned simply because he does not believe in the *sound* of the name or the *word* “Jesus,” but because he does not believe in the Son of God *whom* that word “Jesus” means.

The Savior goes on: “And this is the judgment.” To me it seems that when he says, “This is the judgment,” he means something like this: “This is the truth that judges people: that the light came into the world.”

“The light” is the Son of God, who says in John 8:12: “I am the light of the world.”

“It came” by taking on flesh when the time of prophecy was fulfilled.

“Into the world,” that is, onto the earth among people, to give some measure of light to every person, as Saint John says in chapter 1, verse 9: “There was the true light, which enlightens every person who comes into this world.”

And the Light itself shows why condemnation happens, when it says further: “People loved darkness more than the light.” For no one will be condemned except the one who loves evil deeds more than righteousness; the one who bends himself more toward sin than toward God, who is immeasurable goodness.

So when the Light says, “People loved darkness more than the light,” he is gently describing those people who in the end lean more with their desires toward sin than toward God, the eternal light.

He calls sins “darkness” for three reasons.

First, because they darken a person’s understanding, so that he does not know and does not see God, the true light, or virtue, or even his own self.

Second, because they drag a person into eternal darkness.

Third, because people who sin seek out darkness in order to sin, and they do not want others to know their sins.

Therefore the Savior shows why people loved darkness more than the light. He says: “because their works were evil.”

Saint Bede comments here: those love darkness more than light who hate and slander their preachers when they preach well. And why? Surely because their own works are evil.

The Light continues: “For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light, so that his works will not be punished.”

Here you learn that past sins become a cause of further and greater sin, and of hardening in sin. For the Light says: “because their works were evil.” He is touching on their earlier sins, for which they later loved darkness — that is, sins — more than the eternal light.

Christ shows the burden of sin when he says: “For everyone who does evil” — that is, everyone who sins — “hates the light,” that is, hates Christ, who is the light; “and does not come to the light,” that is, does not come humbly to Christ the Light, “so that his works will not be punished.”

That is one way to understand these words.

Yet know this: a person hates the light in two other ways as well — when he wants to sleep, and when he is out of his mind.

Now, the Savior says that the person who does evil hates the light because he sins mortally. And anyone who sins mortally wants to sleep in sin and is spiritually insane. Therefore everyone who sins mortally hates God, and hates his truth, and hates Scripture, and even hates physical light.

About wicked people, Saint Job says to God in chapter 24, verse 13: “They have been opposed to your light,” that is, to Christ and to his word.

And Saint Daniel, in chapter 13, verses 8–11, says about the two old priests who wanted to commit adultery with holy Susanna against her will: that “they turned their eyes away so that they would not look toward heaven, and they would not remember the righteous judgments of God.”

But the power of God will finally bring all things into the light, where their sins will be punished. For Christ says in Luke, chapter 12, verses 2–3: “Nothing is covered that will not be revealed, and nothing is hidden that will not be known. For what you have said in the dark will be spoken in the light, and what you have whispered into someone’s ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the housetops.”

Ha, ha! Then we will see clearly what we have done in secret before people.

Therefore it is useless for someone to hide mortal sins from people, if in his heart he delights in them. For God sees them everywhere, and on the Day of Judgment he will reveal them to the whole world, and whoever does not repent of them he will condemn forever.

And because good people live in a very different way than evil people — the opposite of them — the eternal Light goes on to say: “But whoever does what is true,” that is, whoever practices virtue that comes from the Truth; whoever not only speaks well but *does* good, “comes to the light,” that is, he draws near to Christ. For “he comes to the light” means: he wants his good works to be known among the people in a way that gives glory to God.

Therefore Christ says: “so that his works may be revealed as having been done in God,” that is, done in the grace of God, without whose power, will, and favor nothing truly good can ever be done.
