This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon introduction from his Postila, where he explains his purpose in preaching the Sunday gospel readings. He emphasizes Christ's mission to testify to truth and guide lost souls, while lamenting the scarcity of faithful preachers despite many eager listeners.

- Jan Hus describes Christ's humble ministry, rejected by proud religious leaders (bishops, priests, scholars) yet driven by compassion (Matthew 9:36-38).  
- He quotes Gregory the Great: "The harvest is plentiful but workers are few," criticizing priests who hold office without fulfilling its duties.  
- Hus commits to:  
  1. Explaining Sunday readings clearly for Czech believers seeking God's will.  
  2. Structuring sermons with Scripture first, then interpretation, so Christ's word "may always shine brightest."  
  3. Encouraging listeners to avoid sin, love God above all, grow in virtue, and pray for him.  
- He cites Luke 11:28: "Blessed are those who hear God’s word and obey it," urging joyful, diligent study and teaching of Scripture.  

**Key Quote**:
> "Blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it." (Luke 11:28)
