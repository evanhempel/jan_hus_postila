1. **Introduction**  
This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon for the First Sunday of Lent, focusing on Jesus's temptation in the wilderness (Matthew 4:1-11). Hus emphasizes Christ's example of overcoming temptation through Scripture and calls Christians to imitate His fasting and resistance to sin.

2. **Bullet points**  
- **Jesus's Temptation**:  
  - Led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil after 40 days of fasting.  
  - Three temptations: turning stones to bread (lust of the flesh), jumping from the temple (pride), and worshiping Satan for worldly power (greed).  
  - Jesus resists each temptation by quoting Scripture (Deuteronomy 8:3; 6:16; 6:13).  

- **Purpose of Lent**:  
  - Christians are called to fast and repent, following Christ’s example.  
  - Fasting curbs bodily desires, elevates the mind to God, and atones for sins (Joel 2:12).  
  - Exceptions are made for the sick, pregnant women, and the poor.  

- **Spiritual Warfare**:  
  - Temptation progresses through suggestion, delight, and consent (citing James 1:15).  
  - Hus warns against pride, greed, and lust—the same sins that defeated Adam but were overcome by Christ.  

- **Role of Scripture**:  
  - Christ’s victory demonstrates the power of God’s Word against temptation.  
  - Hus criticizes church leaders who forbid laypeople from reading Scripture, urging believers to defend themselves with the Bible as Jesus did.
