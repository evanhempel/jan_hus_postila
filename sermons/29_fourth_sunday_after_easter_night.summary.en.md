This summary captures Jan Hus's sermon on John chapter 16, verses 5-15, delivered on the fourth Sunday after Easter. Jan Hus emphasizes Jesus' departure, the coming of the Holy Spirit, and the Spirit's role in convicting the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment.

- **Jesus' Departure**:  
  1. Jesus announces His departure to the Father, explaining it’s necessary for the Holy Spirit to come (John 16:7).

  1. The Holy Spirit will convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8-11).  
      - **Sin**: People do not believe in Jesus (John 16:9).

      - **Judgment**: The devil, ruler of this world, has already been judged (John 16:11).

  1. The Holy Spirit will guide believers into all truth, speaking not on His own but from the Father and Son (John 16:13-15).  
- **Implications for Believers**:  
  1. Believers must focus on spiritual matters rather than earthly distractions.
