title: Reading for the Third Sunday in Advent
---

Jan Hus's sermon for the Third Sunday in Advent focuses on the imprisonment of John the Baptist, Christ's miraculous works, and praise for John. It also emphasizes the importance of faith, humility, and the transformative power of God's Word.

- **John the Baptist's imprisonment**: John was imprisoned by Herod for condemning his adulterous relationship.
- **Christ’s miraculous works**: Jesus highlights His healing of the blind, lame, lepers, deaf, and raising of the dead as signs of His divine mission.
- **Spiritual healing**: Jan Hus explains how Christ's grace heals spiritual blindness, moral weakness, and sin.
- **Blessedness of humility**: Those who remain faithful and do not take offense at Christ are blessed.
- **John the Baptist's role**: John is greater than a prophet; he prepares the way for Christ as foretold in Malachi 3:1.
- **Warning against hypocrisy**: Jan Hus criticizes those who seek comfort and luxury instead of humility and righteousness.
- **Power of God's Word**: Hearing and obeying God's Word brings enlightenment, corrects desires, and fosters God's grace.

> "Blessed is the one who does not take offense at me." - Matthew 11:6
