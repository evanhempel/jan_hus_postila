# Thirteenth Sunday After Holy Trinity

On that day, Jesus said to his disciples: Blessed are the eyes (and therefore the person is blessed) that see the things you see (that is, my humanity and my walking among you). I tell you truly, many kings [David, Solomon] and prophets [Isaiah, Abraham, Haggai] wanted to see (with bodily eyes) the things you see (my humanity, my presence with you, and my works), and they did not see them (with the body); and to hear the things you hear, and they did not hear them (with the body). And look, a certain expert in the Law (a master trained in the Law) stood up (so he would be heard better, and maybe also seen), testing him and saying: Teacher, what must I do to have eternal life (that is, satisfaction of the will without any lack)? And he (Jesus) said to him: In the Law (that is, in God’s Scripture) what is written (for obtaining eternal life)? How do you read it (for your own guidance)? He (the lawyer) answered and said: You shall love the Lord (who created you in power) your God (who knows all things) with all your heart (that is, with understanding without error), with all your soul (that is, with a whole will without resistance), with all your mind (that is, with full memory without forgetting), and with all your strength (that is, with all your efforts), and your neighbor (that is, every human being) as yourself (that is, whatever in need you would rightly want for yourself, you should want that same for him). And he [Jesus] said to him (the lawyer): You have answered correctly (that is, you have spoken the truth). Do this (what the Law says) and you will live (forever in joy). But he, wanting to justify himself (that is, to make himself appear righteous before Jesus, as before a mere man who, he thought, did not know his heart), said to Jesus: And who is my neighbor? And Jesus looked up and said: A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho (to that city) and fell among robbers, who also stripped him; and after putting wounds on him (that is, wounding him), they went away, leaving him half dead (that is, in one way entirely dead). It happened that a priest was going down along that road, and when he saw him he passed by; likewise also a deacon [every man from the tribe of Levi, that son of Jacob, was called a Levite], when he came to that place and saw him, passed by. But a Samaritan (a pagan from that land called Samaria) as he was traveling that road, came near him, and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion; and he came close, bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; then he put him on his own beast, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. The next day he took out two coins, gave them to the innkeeper, and said: Take care of him, and whatever more you spend (that is, whatever extra you lay out), I, when I return, will repay you. Which of these three seems to you to have been a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers? He said: The one who showed him mercy. And Jesus said to him: Go, and you also do the same (that is, be merciful to your neighbor).

**A.** This holy Gospel has many great meanings, yet it can be gathered into three main parts, because first our Savior lays down the beginning of blessedness, which is the goal of our labor—the end we must pursue with all our powers. Blessedness is the best and final end when we arrive there; but it must be the first thing we desire, as the Savior says in Matthew 6:33: Seek first the kingdom of God—that is, first desire blessedness, and be diligent for it. One beginning of that blessedness was to see and hear Christ in a worthy way; for Christ calls those blessed who saw and heard him in the body, as the apostles did, and many other saints. Kings and prophets of the Old Testament longed to have that seeing and hearing, but did not have it. For God arranged it so that some had the beginning of blessedness by faith and inward understanding; some had the beginning of blessedness by bodily seeing and hearing; and some have it in the holy sign which they see with the eyes of the body and believe with the understanding—just as we now see with bodily eyes the form of bread in the Mass, which Christ left us as a memorial of himself, and we believe that under it his body is hidden from bodily senses. But the saints of the Old Testament such as David, Isaiah, Jeremiah had the beginning of blessedness by the vision of faith and inward knowledge; and because they did not have bodily sight, they desired it, if it might be God’s will: *O si videbo!* (O that I might see!) And among the saints of the Old Testament who longed to see Christ in the flesh, the desire of old Simeon and Anna the prophetess was fulfilled, because Simeon, taking him in his arms, said, Luke 2:29–30: Now you let your servant, Lord, go in peace according to your word, for my eyes have seen your Savior (that is, the one given by you). Anna the prophetess also saw him, as did Simeon, and rejoiced, Luke 2:38. The apostles too, seeing him, rejoiced and were already blessed, as were other saints who worthily saw Christ in the flesh, saw his works, and heard his words. Therefore Christ says to his disciples: “Blessed are the eyes that see the things you see.”

**B.** Understand that what is blessed above all is that which knows all things and is pure from every stain in itself. In that sense only God is blessed, because he knows everything and neither has nor can have any stain, and he has this from no one else. Second, something is blessed because it is rational and has no sin at all in it. In this way all holy angels and holy souls in heavenly joy are blessed; and after the Last Judgment all the saints will be blessed in that way. Third, that is blessed which has reason and is free from mortal sin. In this sense every person in this world who is without mortal sin is blessed; and thus the apostles were blessed both before Christ’s death and after his ascension; and now all good Christians without mortal sin are blessed in this way. Fourth, something not rational can be called blessed when it is a part or member of a rational being. So the body of every holy person, and each member—nose, mouth, feet, ears, eyes—is blessed. And it is this kind of blessedness Christ touches here: “Blessed are the eyes that see the things you see.”

**C.** What I have said about blessedness, understand in a similar way about holiness. God is holy because he knows all things and cannot have stain in himself, and he has this holiness from no one else. Next, the saints in heaven are holy because, having reason, they now have no sin at all, even though they could have had sin, and others did. Third, holy people on earth are those who, having reason, have no mortal sin, though they have daily sins. Fourth, their bodies and members are holy because they are a part of their life. Fifth, certain things are called holy because saints used them. Thus the garments of Christ and of the Virgin Mary and of other saints are called holy, though less holy than the bodies of the saints; for Christ redeemed bodies with his blood, but not his own cloak or his mother’s veil; and bodies will be blessed and holy forever, but not Christ’s garment or the garments of other saints. Sixth, something is called holy because it is especially consecrated or given for God’s service. Thus the church building, the chalice, the vestments and other things blessed for God’s praise are called holy. Seventh, things offered to God are called holy; in the Old Testament every firstborn was called holy to the Lord, and now alms given for God’s sake are called holy. Eighth, something is called holy because it signifies something else that is holy. So Scripture is called holy because it signifies the holy God or other holy things. But this holiness is quite small—just as physicians say that water that has passed through a human being is “healthy” because it points to that person’s health, though the water itself has no health in it. In this way, an image that depicts Christ crucified, or the image of another saint, can be called holy; likewise a word or spoken sound is called holy because it signifies something holy. But in the fullest sense holy is God, the angels, and the holy human being, in such a way that this triple holiness can never be lost.

**D.** The reading continues: “And look, a certain expert in the Law stood up, testing him and saying: Teacher, what must I do to have eternal life?” Here the second main part begins: the road by which eternal life is gained, the very thing the lawyer asked Christ about, and Christ in mercy taught him that if he would love God perfectly and love his neighbor, then he would have eternal life. He asked a good question, useful for him and for us, even though his intention was evil, for he asked while testing Christ. Saint Luke notes both—because he both asked a good question and also tempted Christ—when he writes with some wonder: “And look, a certain expert in the Law…” Saint Ambrose says: This man was a “lawyer”—he held the words of the Law, but did not know the understanding of the Law. “He stood up,” so he would be heard better, and perhaps so that people would see him as a good man. “Testing him.” Where he got that temptation from, God knows; perhaps the occasion came from what Christ had just said to the disciples in Luke 10:20: Rejoice that your names are written in heaven. “Teacher, what must I do to have eternal life?” He calls Christ “Teacher,” not “Lord,” perhaps because he wants to know, but not to serve; to hear, but not to obey. He calls him “Teacher” while refusing to be his disciple. Saint John Chrysostom says this man represents those who praise the saints but do not imitate them—that is, those who speak well of holy people but do not follow their example; and that is generally what those are like who know Scripture—many masters and priests. He says, “Teacher, what must I do to have eternal life?” It seems humble, wise, and useful: humble, in that he says “Teacher;” wise, in that he asks “what must I do;” and useful, in that he seeks “eternal life.” Wise, because he asks, “what must I do”—not just what must I know, or read, or say, but “what must I do.” For Christ says in Matthew 5:19: Whoever does and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

**E.** At the end of this Gospel Christ says: “Go, and do likewise!” And from the time after his baptism Christ began to preach, saying in Matthew 3: Do repentance, for the kingdom of heaven has drawn near. So the man truly asked a good question when he said, “What must I do to have eternal life”—that is, eternal joy, which is the sight of the eternal Holy Trinity, just as the Savior says in John 17:3: Eternal life is this, that they may know you, the only true God, and him whom you have sent, Jesus Christ. Understand: every person will live forever and will in that sense have his own “eternal life”; but not everyone will have *the* eternal life that is the knowing of the Holy Trinity in joy forever—where the holy person, by his understanding, will know the Holy Trinity and Christ as man with his bodily eyes; and from that eternal knowing he will have great comfort and rest, and such satisfaction in both his understanding and will that he will have everything he wants without lack. That satisfaction is called “eternal life,” or eternal blessedness, about which Christ says: “Blessed are the eyes that see the things you see”—that is, see worthily. And conversely, cursed are the eyes that see unworthily, like the eyes of Judas, Pilate, Herod, and the priests who saw the same things as the apostles yet insulted the Savior. In the same way, understand that blessed are the eyes that worthily see the form of bread in the Mass in which is the body of Christ; and cursed are the eyes that see it unworthily.

**F.** The reading goes on: “And he”—that is, Jesus—“said to him,” the lawyer: “In the Law”—that is, in God’s Scripture, which is Law above all other laws, and in which the righteous person is to meditate day and night, as David the prophet says in Psalm 1:2—“What is written there for obtaining eternal life? How do you read it for your own guidance—how do you read it, you who are a teacher of others? How do you read—carefully? constantly? usefully?” If only Christ would ask each of us: What is written in God’s Law? And how do you read? Many, especially those who should show others the way to eternal life, would fall silent, not knowing what is written in God’s Law. But if he asked them: How many sums of pay, how much oats, how many hens and eggs? Or on which day do you receive your tithes or your dues?—they would answer at once! If he asked each of us: How do you read? many consciences would have to reply: “carelessly, without devotion, and wrongly.” For some read but do not fulfill what they read, like those of whom Christ says in Matthew 23:2–3: The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat; so do and keep whatever they tell you, but do not follow their works, for they say and do not do. In Moses’ seat sit popes, bishops, and other spiritual officials who lay many commands on others and do not do them themselves. Others, however, read and do and teach, as the apostles and their faithful successors did, following their Savior, of whom Saint Luke says in Acts 1:1: Jesus began to do and to teach. Some read and do but do not teach others publicly in church—such are faithful lay people, men and women, whose example teaches better than the priests; and they are more profitable teachers than priests who teach with words but tear down with their works. Therefore Saint Bernard says: Preaching by example is more fruitful than preaching only with words.

**G.** The Gospel continues: “He answered and said: You shall love…” and so on. This man knew the words of God’s Law; therefore Saint Luke calls him an “expert in the Law.” He knew that it is written in God’s Law, in the fifth book, Deuteronomy 6:5: You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. And of neighbor it is written in the third book, Leviticus 19, You shall love your friend as yourself. And though the words are not exactly the same as in the Gospel, the meaning is completely the same. The phrase “with all your strength” has the same weight as “with all your powers,” and the word “friend” in the second commandment means the same as “neighbor.” And where in the Gospel it is added, “with all your mind,” that is meant in this Scripture when it says in Deuteronomy 4:9: Do not forget the things your eyes have seen, and let them not slip from your heart all the days of your life; you shall teach them to your children and grandchildren. And again in Deuteronomy 6:6–9: These words that I command you today shall be in your heart; you shall speak of them to your children; you shall remember them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down and when you rise; you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be between your eyes and never move; and you shall write them on your doorposts and on your gates.

**H.** See, then, how clearly it is laid down that a person must love the Lord God with all his mind. Know that to love God means to will good to God rightly; and a person wills good to God rightly when, having no mortal sin, he praises God, obeys him, and most of all clings to him by love, as I wrote in the sermon for Pentecost. So the lawyer quotes from God’s Law like this: “You shall love the Lord,” who powerfully created you, can protect and reward you, and if you are evil, has power over you everywhere to punish you; “God,” who is wise, knowing all things from eternity, before whom nothing can be hidden; “your God,” who by his immeasurable goodness has made himself yours, given himself to you for eternal joy, if you will love him above all other things. Thus, “you shall love the Lord” for his power, “God” for his wisdom, “your” God for his goodness. “You shall love” means you shall want and rejoice that he is the almighty Lord over all lords, that he is the God who knows everything, because he is immeasurably wise, and that he is immeasurably good, goodness without limit. From his unlimited power, wisdom, and goodness he created all things, including you; therefore you shall love him as Creator, as Sustainer, and as the one who glorifies all his chosen ones in eternal joy. For after creating, he sustains; and afterward he makes his lovers glorious. And because he is the infinite Good, the best Good, “you shall love him” above all and “with all your heart”—that is, with understanding free from error; “with all your soul”—that is, with a whole will without resistance; “with all your mind”—that is, with full memory without forgetting; “with all your strength”—that is, with all diligence: so that you apply all your efforts to your understanding, so as not to stray from God; all your efforts to your will, so that you choose nothing above God, nor choose anything against his will; and all your efforts and strength to your memory, so that you do not forget God. Yet, as Saint Augustine says, a mortal person cannot fulfill this perfectly here on earth; he only begins, as best he can, what he will fully complete in the joy of heaven.

**I.** The Gospel goes on: “and your neighbor as yourself.” Know that to love your neighbor means to will good to your neighbor rightly. And the good that is truly good for your neighbor is, first, that he be without mortal sin, and finally that he be saved; these two goods are best for him. Therefore every person, as he should desire these two things most of all for himself, must desire them also for his neighbor, according to God’s will. And since, as Saint Augustine says, “neighbor” means every human being, therefore each person, as long as he lives in this world, is neighbor to each other person; and thus each person should desire for every other, as for himself, the forgiveness of sins and eternal joy. If your neighbor dies and is in heaven, then you should gladly rejoice in that for him; if he is in purgatory, you should pray to God for him; if he is in hell, like Judas, then you should accept that he suffers those torments, because it is God’s will that he suffer them.

I said that to love your neighbor kindly and rightly is to will good to your neighbor rightly. From this you may see that whoever draws his neighbor toward sin does not truly love him, just as he does not truly love himself when he sins. For David the prophet says in Psalm 11:5: Whoever loves wickedness hates his own soul. From this you further see that people who help one another to sin are not faithful friends to each other, but traitors and enemies. But when, by good living, you draw your neighbor away from sin—by counsel, warning, preaching, gifts, threats, or even just punishment rightly used—then you are his true friend. For Saint Gregory says: The one will be truly my friend who wipes the stains from my soul—that is, by admonishing, teaching, or any other good means. And each person must love his neighbor in such a way that whatever he would rightly and reasonably want for himself in the same situation, that he should want also for his neighbor; and whatever he would rightly and reasonably not want for himself, that he should not want for his neighbor.

You say: “My neighbor is a thief, an adulterer, or otherwise wicked. How am I to love him as myself?” I answer: You must love in your neighbor what God has created in him as God’s work and temple—that is, his soul and his body; but you must not love in him adultery or any other wickedness. Thus, when someone finds the sin of his neighbor truly disgusting and would gladly see him free from that sin, then he loves him—provided first that he himself is free from mortal sin. And the more his neighbor’s sin grieves him, and the greater his desire that the neighbor be rid of sin, the more he loves him. Just as you, in distress, would want help from a neighbor who could help you, so you, if you are able, must help your neighbor who deserves that help, and do so mercifully. When Scripture says, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” it does not command you to love him as greatly as yourself, nor more than yourself, but to love him toward the same end as yourself, that is, toward eternal joy; and for the same reason as yourself, that is, because he is God’s image and creature; and in the same order as yourself—but yourself first, and more.

The reading continues: “Jesus said to him: You have answered correctly; do this and you will live.” Christ praises his answer and commands him to live well, saying: “You have answered correctly” (you have spoken the truth); “do this” (what the Law commands), “and you will live” forever in joy.

**K.** “But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus: And who is my neighbor?” Here begins the third part of the holy reading: the order or way in which God’s command is to be fulfilled. Wanting to know this order, the lawyer asks who his neighbor is. Therefore the Gospel says, “He, wanting to justify himself”—in Latin, *justificare se ipsum*, that is, wanting to show himself to be righteous before people and before Christ, as before a man who, he thought, did not know his heart. Yet it seems to me that here *justificare se ipsum* simply means “to set himself right,” and I have translated it that way, and nothing is lost; for to set oneself right before people is to show oneself righteous. Whether that lawyer wanted to show himself righteous before Christ, or truly to be instructed about who his neighbor is—as his words and Christ’s both may suggest—that our beloved Christ knows best. “Jesus looked up and said: A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho…” and so on. When Christ “looked up,” he gave us this lesson: whoever wants to teach another usefully for salvation must seek help from the Lord of heaven. Second, he signifies that humankind fell from heavenly joy by disobedience. Third, he shows that he himself is, in the parable, the Samaritan who, being God, became incarnate to become our neighbor and to heal wounded humanity with the oil of his mercy and the wine of holy repentance, taking on suffering in his human body for our sake.

The Gospel says: “Jesus looked up and said: A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers.” I do not know whether this literally happened, but I know it is true in the sense Christ intends. It could well have happened, for between Jerusalem and Jericho there was a wilderness where robbers attacked people; and there King Zedekiah was captured as he fled from Jerusalem from the army of the king of Babylon, as the prophet Jeremiah writes in his last chapter, Jeremiah 52:8. But in the spiritual sense this man, as I have written in a whole separate sermon about him, is all humankind struck down by sin. “The man was going down” by disobedience “from Jerusalem,” that is, from the vision of peace (for “Jerusalem” means “vision of peace”), “to Jericho,” that is, into the troubles and miseries of this changeable life (for “Jericho” means change, inconstancy, or transformation). See how this happened. Adam, before his fall into sin, had peace in three ways: peace with God through obedience, peace with himself through innocence, and peace with the world through dominion, so that after God he was lord of the whole world. But when he listened to the serpent and broke God’s command, then he went down into the loss of peace through sin, so that peace failed him with God, with himself, and with the world; and he came into a hard change: whereas he could have not died, once he sinned he had to die; whereas he could have had the kingdom of heaven without misery, he had to become miserable. See how sin drove him far from the kingdom of heaven! That is what Christ means when he says, “A man was going down from Jerusalem.” Second, sin threw him into misery, for he “went to Jericho.” Third, sin subjected him to the devils, for he “fell among robbers.” Fourth, sin stripped him of God’s grace, “for they stripped him.” Fifth, sin wounded him in his natural powers, for Christ says, “they put wounds on him.” Sixth, sin killed him in his soul, for Christ says, “leaving him half dead.” A person is wholly alive when his soul is in his body and the grace of the Holy Spirit is in his soul; but he is half alive when his soul keeps his body alive, but the grace of the Holy Spirit does not keep his soul alive. Thus every person in mortal sin, although alive in body, is only half alive; he is that man wounded by robbers. Likewise, the saints in heaven whose bodies are dead and decaying or have decayed are half alive and half dead; and on Judgment Day they will be fully alive with that life of which Christ speaks here: “Do this and you will live.”

So Christ says: “A man”—that is, Adam and his sinful offspring—“was going down” by the sin of disobedience “from Jerusalem,” from the vision of peace, “to Jericho,” into misery, “and fell among robbers,” that is, among devils, “who stripped him completely,” that is, stripping him of innocence, taking off his garment of innocence and clothing him in their own garment—guilt. “And they put wounds on him,” that is, they wounded the powers God had given: his understanding, will, memory, and bodily strength; these wounds are sins with which the devil has wounded the person. “And went away”—that is, they withdrew from open attack and hid their tricks. Know this: the devils did not leave the human race so completely as to stop tempting us, but they hid their cunning from people; and at other times they also depart from a particular person. So Christ says: “They went away, leaving him half dead.” “Now it happened that a priest was going down on that road, and when he saw him he passed by; likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by.” This priest represents all the priests of the Old Testament, and the Levite all the prophets. They walked that same road, that is, they too were under original sin, and yet they passed by the wounded man without giving him the help that only Christ could give.

**M.** “But a certain Samaritan”—that is Christ—who is called Samaritan because he is the watchman of his faithful ones (for *Samaritanus* means “watchman”), and Christ is the watchman to whom Job says in Job 7:20: O watcher of men, why have you made me your target? And David the prophet says, Psalm 127:1: Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain. That he is Samaritan in the sense of “watchman” he did not deny when the priests said to him, John 8:48: You are a Samaritan and have a demon. As Saint Gregory notes, Christ did not answer, “I am not a Samaritan,” but he answered, John 8:49: I do not have a demon. This Samaritan, Christ, “as he journeyed”—that is, as he walked the road, becoming man for us—“came to him,” that is, he drew near to the wounded man, taking on, apart from spiritual nakedness and apart from sin, all the sufferings of humanity: hunger, thirst, heat, cold, sorrow, pain, even death, as our faith teaches. And Saint Paul says to the Hebrews, 2:17, that he had to be made like his brothers in every way, though he could not sin. “This Samaritan,” seeing with the eye of his mercy, “was moved with compassion, and came near,” so near to the wounded man that he could not have been nearer; for being God, he did not, as Saint Paul says (Hebrews 2:16–17), take on the nature of angels, but he took on human nature so that, as man, he might be our brother and neighbor. “He bound up his wounds,” first stopping the blood in baptism so it would no longer flow—that is, cooling the sin that runs through the person until baptism. He bound up the wounds by his grace, so that now every power of body and soul can be restored to its former health, so that the person will be as healthy in his powers in blessedness as he was in Paradise. “He bound up the wounds, pouring on oil,” that is, mercy, “and wine,” that is, repentance, suffering, or discipline. “He put him on his own beast,” that is, he took the burden of suffering for him on his own human body; for he says through David, Psalm 49:13: I was made like a beast before you. For what purpose? To carry the sinner—that is, to bear suffering for his sins. Therefore Isaiah says, 53:4: Truly he has borne our sicknesses and carried our pains. “He brought him to an inn,” that is, into the holy assembly of the faithful where the wounded are healed when they repent of their sins. “And he took care of him,” and that with very great care—more than thirty-two years of painful labor for him. What earthly doctor could give such care to a bodily wounded man as Christ has given? “The next day,” that is, in the time of grace, “he took out two denarii,” that is, he made known the Old and New Testaments, on which the image of the eternal King is stamped; “and gave them to the innkeeper,” that is, to the priest who should know both Testaments; this priest represents all the priests of the New Testament. “And he said to him: Take care of him,” that is, heal him, not strip him, not fleece him, not wound him further and kill him. “And whatever you spend,” that is, whatever work, help, and strength you lay out, “I, when I return,” that is, on Judgment Day, “will repay,” that is, I will pay you back according to how much good you have done.

**N.** Note that in Latin it says: *quodcumque supererogaveris*—that is, whatever you add beyond, meaning not only that you rightly use both Testaments, but that you also add your own good example and even risk your own life. Would that the “innkeepers” at least paid out those two denarii! Sadly, there are few who “supererogate” in the sense Christ intends here, who then asks: “Which of these three seems to you to have been a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?”—the priest, the Levite, or the Samaritan? “He said: The one who showed mercy to him.” See how he judges nearness by mercy, saying that the Samaritan, a foreigner, was more neighbor to the wounded man of Jerusalem than the priest and Levite of his own people who did not show him mercy.

**O.** Here we can see that mercy is to be shown to every person in need, whether Jew, pagan, or wicked Christian. For immediately Christ says: “Go, and you also do the same.” That is: whenever you can, be merciful to every person in need; for every human being is your neighbor: Jew, pagan, heretic, even a Christian who is your enemy. In this merciful example the gentle Savior shows that every person is neighbor to every other person. In Latin it says *proximus*, that is, “the nearest,” for every human being is so near to every other in our shared humanity that he cannot be nearer as man. Other kinds of nearness—by family, by place, by kinship—are not so constant that they would make every person the “nearest” to every other person. There is, besides, a special nearness among the children of God who are chosen for salvation, and that nearness cannot be diminished or increased; for the nearest Father to those chosen children is Christ, and the holy Church—that is, the assembly of the elect—is the Mother. Thus all the elect are spiritual brothers, with one Father and one Mother, who especially cry together to God, Matthew 6:9: Our Father who art in heaven. By teaching this nearness, Christ, in the parable of this Gospel, shows that every person should be neighbor to every other person in desire. From this it follows that, of the three, Christ alone was truly the nearest neighbor in his heart’s desire.

Therefore you, who want to have blessedness that comes from being a neighbor, “go and do likewise,” following that Samaritan, Christ, in your desire—not identically, for you are not God and man as Christ is, but in this way: whatever you do, do it for the benefit of the holy Church, and by Christ’s power do whatever you can so that you may be a true member of Jesus Christ. From this it follows that only the one is a neighbor worthy of the kingdom of heaven who eagerly helps his neighbor with works of mercy so that the holy Church may be healthy in her children. And holy children—baptized infants—are also neighbors, for although they do not yet have an active desire for others’ good, they possess innocence from baptism and thus help to complete the number of God’s children. And when they come to years of understanding, then, obeying Christ, they must also act mercifully toward their neighbors, as that blessed Samaritan—Christ, the eternal Watchman of his faithful ones—did and always does.
