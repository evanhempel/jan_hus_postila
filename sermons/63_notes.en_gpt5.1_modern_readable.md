## NOTES

### I.

Hus’s *Postilla* – *Vyloženie svatých čtenie nedělních*, as the author himself calls it – was printed three times in the 16th century. The first printing is from the year 1563, when it was published “in the famous imperial city of Nuremberg” by Jan Montanus and Oldřich Neyber. Its title was: “The Postil of blessed memory Master Jan Hus, God’s martyr, on the Gospels that are read throughout the whole year. To which are added many other books by that same Master Jan Hus, which have never before been printed, and are only now brought to light. 1563.” This edition has a foreword by Hus, which appears at the very beginning of our edition as well, then a preface by the printer, followed by another preface by Hus, which in our edition is attached after the “Index.” There is also a picture of Master Jan Hus at the stake, with a Latin inscription above and Czech verses below. In this first printing other writings of the Master are also attached. The *Postilla* takes up the first 145 pages. What is especially interesting is that its text corresponds most closely to the manuscript in the National Museum. In 1564 the *Postilla* was printed again, place unknown – probably somewhere in Germany – and in 1592 it appeared once more in Nuremberg; that last one is only a reissue of the earlier edition with a new cover.

After a long break it was printed again only in more recent times. Karel Jaromír Erben, as “director of the archive and other auxiliary offices of the Prague magistrate,” published “The Collected Czech Writings of Master Jan Hus” in three volumes in 1865, 1866, and 1868, with substantial help from Russian friends. The *Postilla* is the second volume of these Writings. Erben notes right after the title page that the text of his edition is based “on a paper folio manuscript from the year 1414 in the library of the National Museum in Prague.” This is the so‑called Horčička manuscript, named after the academic painter František Horčička, to whom it once belonged; it is described in detail in Bartoš’s catalogue of manuscripts of the National Museum I, pp. 195–196. It bears the shelfmark IV C 18 and contains 233 leaves, of which 196 belong to the *Postilla*, while the remaining leaves contain other writings by Hus. The copying of the *Postilla* was finished by Zikmund of Domažlice on 24 November 1414. Even though in terms of extent it is the best-preserved manuscript, part of the fourth reading is missing in it. Erben filled this gap from a manuscript in the National and University Library in Prague, shelfmark XVII A 11; he notes this in a footnote on p. 20. In addition to these manuscripts he also had in hand the Bautzen manuscript, as he says in III, p. 329, though that one is missing the ending. So he used only three manuscripts for the text of his edition. For comparison he also used the Nuremberg printing from 1563.

After a pause of more than thirty years, the *Postilla* received another printing in 1900, in a fine edition prepared by Václav Flajšhans, who, however, transferred the text into modern Czech. Illustrations by Ladislav Novák are attached. It is a bibliophile edition, published at the expense of J. R. Vilímek in Prague.

At the beginning of the new century more editions followed at a fairly quick pace. In 1904 Flajšhans, in cooperation with Milan Svoboda, began publishing the first series of Hus’s works, which included Hus’s Latin writings in three volumes, translated by Svoboda. The second series, which followed soon afterward (the year of publication is not given), also contains three volumes, into which the Czech writings were included. The last volume is the *Postilla*, again rendered in modern Czech. The publisher was J. R. Vilímek in Prague. Shortly afterward, in 1906, František Žilka published it in the new orthography and supplied it with notes.

Our present edition is only the eighth, even though this particular work of Hus would certainly have deserved more attention.

As for the manuscripts of the *Postilla*, its translations into Latin and German, and the literature dealing with it, I can refer to *Literární činnost M. J. Husi* (Prague 1948) by F. M. Bartoš (pp. 110–111). From there I mention only that besides the three manuscripts used by Erben, we now have three other contemporary manuscripts and several fragmentary ones. A philologist who would bring all of these together to reconstruct the text as it may have come from Hus’s own hand has not yet appeared.

### II.

Since almost half a century has passed since the last edition of the *Postilla*, and given the importance and interest of this work of Hus, it is only natural that there has been a growing sense that it ought to appear again. The call for a new edition comes not only from specialists, who until now have used Erben’s edition – itself now a sought‑after rarity – but also from the general Czech reading public, who would gladly have a new printing in their hands. For this reason the Comenius Faculty decided to undertake a new edition of the Reformer’s writings and to begin precisely with the *Postilla*.

1. Since we wanted to serve both a broader readership and scholars, we had to face the question: what should the new edition of the *Postilla* look like? Should it be a critical edition, taking into account all known manuscripts and printings? Already in the preface F. M. Bartoš states that such an edition is now planned and assigned to the Czech Academy. But that kind of edition would be accessible only to academic specialists. We are convinced that we would not meet the general demand if we tried to produce a fully critical text.

We also asked whether it would be appropriate to publish the *Postilla* in translation into modern Czech. We realized, however, that this would have to be a translation, not just a simple transcription or modernization – in other words, a careful philological task, which again would not fully satisfy the experts. So we decided on a middle way and are publishing Erben’s text. We believe – and I think with good reason – that the broader public who reaches for the *Postilla* will, on the whole, be able to understand the older Czech, especially if they make use of the small glossary of Old Czech expressions that we have compiled and attached to this edition. It is based on the excellent *Slovník k českým spisům Husovým* by Karel Novák, which appeared in the *Archiv pro lexikografii a dialektologii* published by the Czech Academy of Sciences and Arts, Prague 1934. We have also taken into account the *Slovníček staré češtiny* by František Šimek, Matice česká – Orbis, Prague 1947. On the other hand, our edition can also be used by demanding specialists who have so far worked with Erben’s edition, until they have the critical edition from the Czech Academy. In adopting Erben’s text, we have kept his layout, especially the punctuation, and following his example we have placed the “Index” at the back, left the reference letters in the margins, and we also include the “Supplement,” which contains a different sermon on the 46th reading, taken from the *Postilla* of 1563.

### III.

2. We have, however, omitted the footnotes that Erben gives. We are only now attaching them. They are the following: On p. 20, line 7 from the top (our p. 32, line 20 from the top), at the word “jenž” in the second‑to‑last sentence of the reading’s text, he notes: “Here in the museum manuscript a leaf was torn out and has been replaced from the manuscript of the Imperial Royal Public Library XVII. A. 11, up to the words ‘(dósto)jenstvie vyznává Jan, řka’ on p. 22” (our p. 34, line 8 from the bottom). On p. 142, line 2 from the bottom (our p. 164, line 2 from the top), at the words “božieho těla” he notes in a footnote: “Here written above the line in a later hand and with different ink: ‘and his holy blood,’ which words the manuscript from the public library also does not have.” On p. 143, line 3 from the top (our p. 164, line 6 from the top), at the words “Augustina svatého” he notes below: “This entire passage about the testimony of St. Augustine has been heavily crossed out with ink in the museum manuscript so that it cannot be read; in the printed *Postillas* the whole section listed here under ‘Seventh’ is missing. These changes clearly come from the Utraquists, for whom those passages were inconvenient.” On p. 160, line 6 from the top (our p. 182, line 2 from the top), at the words “ten kacieř” Erben notes: “What is placed here and elsewhere in brackets [ ], is written in both manuscripts – the museum manuscript and that of the Imperial Public Library – between the lines or also in the margin.” At the word “širocě” on p. 336, line 1 from the top (our p. 367, line 3 from the bottom) he notes: “This sermon is attached at the end of this *Postilla*.” On p. 384, line 14 from the bottom (our p. 419, line 8 from the top), at the words “né brž je zamietati” he says below: “Both manuscripts have: ‘neb je zamietati,’ and the printed *Postilla* ‘neb je zamietá.’” Finally, on p. 411, line 12 from the bottom (our p. 447, line 15 from the top), at the word “zlosyny” he notes: “Both manuscripts and the printing have: ‘zlosynem.’”

3. As for the biblical quotations, in Erben’s text they are of two kinds: some are accompanied by a reference, others are quoted without any reference. In the first case, the biblical book is usually cited by its Latin abbreviation with the chapter number. Hus, of course, did not have verse numbers; that system appears only after the work of the Paris printer Robert Estienne in 1551. For the reader’s easier orientation, we have added verse numbers. In the names of the books we have kept Hus’s designations. Because there are differences in chapter and verse numbering – especially in the Psalms, where in the Latin Vulgate not only the numbering of the Psalms but also of the verses differs from what readers know from the Bibles most familiar to them – we have listed, in the biblical index, the numbering according to the Vulgate alongside the numbering according to the Kralice Bible of 1613.

In the second case, where Hus quotes Scripture but does not give a reference, we have supplied it by generally writing out the name of the book in Czech along with the chapter and verse according to the Kralice Bible, so that the reader can easily recognize Hus’s original quotation and distinguish it from the reference we have identified. Incorrect references are left unchanged in the text, but in the list of biblical passages we point to the correct location. For citing the apocryphal books we have followed the Vulgate, using its Antwerp edition of 1643, which we have also used overall when locating passages in the canonical books.

In the attached list of biblical places, those passages quoted by Hus are listed without brackets; references supplied by us are in brackets. The apocryphal books are arranged in the list according to the Czech Bible (the Halle edition) of 1766. Doubtful references are marked with a question mark.

4. Besides the many biblical quotations, Hus also gives numerous quotations from the Church Fathers and other Christian writers. We have not checked their accuracy or original form; that properly belongs to a critical edition. But in the name index we have listed the names with brief information about each.

5. Because, in his way of preaching, Hus naturally relates to the circumstances of the time in which he lived, we also provide a list of more significant historical allusions, which may be of particular interest to readers.

6. We likewise list the places where Hus mentions himself or refers to his own writings.

7. We do not add a subject index, but leave in place the “Index” that the author himself compiled.

8. Finally, we attach the already mentioned glossary of Old Czech expressions.

In the hope that both general readers and researchers will show understanding for the possible shortcomings that slip even into the most careful work, we wish this edition of Hus’s *Postilla* to be kindly received by all, and that reading this precious book may bring rich benefit to each one.

I thank Professor Dr. F. M. Bartoš as a brother for the valuable advice and guidance with which he willingly accompanied this work.
