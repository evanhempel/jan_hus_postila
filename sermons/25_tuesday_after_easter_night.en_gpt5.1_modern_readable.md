# Tuesday After Easter Night

Saint Luke, chapter 24, verses 36–47.

At that time Jesus stood among his disciples and said to them, “Peace to you! It is I; do not be afraid.” But they were troubled and terrified, and thought they were seeing a spirit. And he said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do [evil] thoughts rise up in your hearts? Look at my hands and my feet, that it is really I myself. Touch me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.” And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. And when they still did not believe and were amazed because of joy, he said, “Do you have anything here that can be eaten [that I might eat]?” And they gave him a piece of broiled fish and a honeycomb. And when he had eaten in front of them, taking what was left, he gave it to them and said, “These are the words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms must be fulfilled.” Then he opened their understanding so that they could understand the Scriptures. And he said to them that it is written, and that it was necessary for Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead on the third day, and that they should preach in his name repentance [that people should repent] and forgiveness of sins [when they repent] among all nations [that is, among all peoples].

In this holy reading Saint Luke shows us how Jesus appeared for the fifth time after his resurrection. This appearance happened on Sunday, when the two disciples were coming back from Emmaus and were telling the others what had happened on the road and how they had recognized him in the breaking of the bread.

Our dear Savior proves his resurrection to his disciples using three of the senses: sight, touch, and taste. Then he finishes by appealing to the Scriptures, which they hear, when he says, “These are the words that I spoke to you while I was still with you.” So the whole reading is about the resurrection of Jesus Christ, of whom it is written: “Jesus stood among his disciples.” He stood in the middle so that they could all see him, so that he might be ready to show himself to all of them, and so that all of them might believe.

“And he said to them: ‘Peace to you!’” He speaks to them with his usual greeting, to drive away their fear and quiet their hearts in faith, and to show that he is the same one who had commanded them before his death, as it is written in Mark 10: “Whatever house you enter, greet it, saying, ‘Peace to this house!’” Therefore he says, “Peace to you! It is I; do not be afraid.”

Know this: Christ’s disciples were afraid of the Jews, as Saint John testifies (John 20:19). So our dear Savior gives them peace, that they might not be afraid, for right away he says to them, “Do not be afraid.”

Second, they did not have peace with God, because they had not believed that Christ would rise from the dead. So they were without peace both in their bodies and in their souls. They needed their merciful Savior to give them peace, for this is why he took flesh, was born, was crucified, and rose again—to make peace between God and human beings, between one person and another, and between a person and his own soul.

A person breaks peace with God in three main ways.

First, when he commits a mortal sin out of weakness, for example, out of fear, being afraid of death. Then he breaks peace especially with God the Father, who has given a person the power to stand firm and not consent to mortal sin until death, preferring rather to suffer than to agree to deadly sin. In this way Peter especially broke the peace of God the Father when he denied Christ out of fear of death.

Second, a person breaks peace with the Son of God when he sins out of ignorance or foolishness, for Christ has given wisdom to people so that they might know how to avoid sin. In this way Paul broke peace, when he opposed the members of Christ. So he says himself (1 Timothy 1:13): “I acted in ignorance.”

Third, a person breaks the peace of the Holy Spirit when he sins out of malice, like Judas, who betrayed his Master out of greed, and like the chief priests and scribes, who handed him over to death out of envy. In the same way today many people break the peace of the Holy Spirit—especially masters, priests, learned men, and clever people of the world—who sin without fear of death, fully knowing that something is sin, and yet still commit it.

Oh, how many greedy Judases and how many adulterous priests and others there are, who sin against their own understanding, knowing for certain that usury, simony, sexual immorality, hatred, and gambling are mortal sins! These are the people who most need our merciful Christ to say to them, “Peace to you!”

This peace is the quiet of the will in virtue. Whoever has a quiet, settled will in doing what is good does not commit mortal sin. Such a one has peace with God, for there is no malice in him against God. He has peace with his neighbor, because he loves his neighbor as himself. And he has peace with his own soul, because he does not burden it with mortal sin.

This peace our merciful Savior gave to his disciples and to all others who love him with their whole heart. These do not need to be afraid, for Christ says, “Peace to you! It is I; do not be afraid.” Do not be afraid of me as of a monster, nor as of a ghost; I am the same one who lived with you before my death and died on the cross for you; and now I am alive, that same Jesus—do not be afraid!

Yet even though he greeted them so kindly and showed himself to them, their fear and unbelief did not immediately end. So the reading says: “They were troubled and terrified, and thought they were seeing a spirit.” Three things came upon them: confusion, fear, and error—because of unbelief. They were afraid as if they saw a dead man, and they were in error, thinking they saw something monstrous, for they thought they were seeing a spirit—that Christ was not the real, physical man who had died on the cross.

Saint Bede says: The disciples, having known Christ as a real man with whom they had lived for such a long time, did not believe that after he died he could, on the third day, rise again as a real, bodily man. So they thought they were seeing a spirit which he had breathed out when he died. This is why the reading says, “They thought they were seeing a spirit.” This error of the apostles is the error of the Manicheans. So far Bede.

He took this explanation from Saint Augustine, and the two agree that the apostles had fallen into the same error later held by the heretic Manichaeus, who said that Christ did not have a real human body like ours, but only an apparent body. The disciples fell into that error here, thinking they saw only a spirit and not the bodily Christ.

But our merciful Savior did not allow them to remain in this error for long. The reading continues: “And he said to them, ‘Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts rise up in your hearts?’” Here he shows himself to be God, revealing to them their inner thoughts. In this way the merciful Jesus reaches his divine hand into their hearts, both comforting and rebuking them: comforting them when he says, “Why are you troubled?” and rebuking them when he adds, “and thoughts”—that is, false, evil thoughts—“rise up in your hearts?”

He says “rise up” because those evil thoughts did not come down from above, from God, but rose up from below, from the devil. Just as every good thought has its beginning in God, so every evil thought has its beginning in the devil. From him come every lie and every false and sinful error.

Saint Bede comments: What thoughts? False and evil ones. For Christ would lose the benefit of his sufferings if his resurrection were not true. Think of a good plowman who says, “What I have sown, I will find here”—that is the faith which has come down into the heart from above. But these thoughts did not come down from above; they rose up from below into the heart like bubbles climbing upward. So far that dear blind man Bede.

“Look at my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh or muscles and bones as you see that I have.” He said this, Saint Ambrose notes, to show them the hope of their own resurrection. For anything solid that can be touched is a body, and in a body we will rise again—only then it will be a glorious body, not this coarse one. So far Ambrose.

But spiritually Jesus, by showing his hands and feet, lets us know what good he has done for us and from what kind of desire he has done it. In Scripture, “hands” often mean actions, and “feet” desires. So the disciples of Christ should consider well what good Christ has done for them, and from what loving desire he did it. By understanding and recognizing this, we should highly value his great kindness.

“And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet,” in which the nails had been driven on the cross, and where the wounds remained.

Why did he leave the marks of the wounds, when he easily could have healed them, having already done the greater work of rising from the dead?

First, to strengthen the faith of his disciples.

Second, so that he might show them to the Father as he intercedes for us, reminding him of the death he suffered for humanity.

Third, so that he might show them to those he has redeemed, his sons and daughters, as proof of how mercifully he has rescued them from eternal condemnation.

Fourth, so that on Judgment Day he might show them to the wicked, proving that they are justly condemned because they were not grateful for such a great gift.

And fifth, so that he might show them forever to all his saints, that they might rejoice that they have been so greatly loved by their Savior.

“And when they still did not believe”—that is, not fully, for they had begun to believe—“and were amazed” at this strange and new thing, that the man Christ himself had risen from the dead, “they were amazed because of joy” that they now had, seeing their dear and comforting Lord. As Saint John says (John 20:20), “The disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.” Before, they had been startled and afraid; now they rejoiced.

To reassure them even more, to comfort and gladden them, he said, “Do you have anything here that can be eaten?” That is: Do you have something you can give me to eat?

Bede says: To prove his true resurrection, he was not content merely to be touched by the disciples, but also chose to eat with them, so that they would not suppose he had risen in some incomplete way, but would believe that he truly had risen. So far Bede.

Understand: he chose to eat not because his body needed food, and not because we will need bodily food after death, but to prove that he has a real, living body. Apparent bodies, which evil spirits sometimes put on to appear to people, cannot eat, because they are not alive, even if the devil may seem to grip or carry them.

“And they gave him a piece of broiled fish and a honeycomb. And when he had eaten in front of them, taking what was left, he gave it to them.” As already said, he ate to prove the reality of his body and his resurrection. He did this not by necessity, but freely and with power. In this there is a lesson: sometimes a person may eat for the benefit of others out of love, even if his own body has no need at that moment.

Why did Christ, after his resurrection, eat broiled fish twice?

Saint Gregory says *In om.* that this is not without purpose, but contains a hidden teaching. He says the broiled fish represents Christ who suffered. For he chose to hide himself in the waters—that is, in the temptations of human life. He allowed himself to be caught in the snare of our death and was “broiled” in the time of his suffering. As for the honeycomb, he was that for us in the resurrection.

Gregory adds that in this one thing Christ wanted to show us two realities. In the wax there is a middle, a core: in the wax the center is the honey. So in Christ, the “honey” is the Godhead in the humanity. He ate fish and bread; for he who could be broiled like a fish in his humanity has fed us as bread from his divinity. He says in John 6:51, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.” He ate the broiled fish and the bread, to show by this food that he has borne our suffering through his humanity and prepared our satisfaction through his divinity.

So explains Saint Gregory. Whoever is able, let him “eat” Christ crucified as the broiled fish, and as the bread; and let him eat the “honey,” that is, partake of the divinity of Christ as the sweetest thing. For David says (Psalm 34:9), “Taste and see how sweet the Lord is.” So, following Christ, we are to eat both the broiled fish and the bread—but with honey. Whatever we suffer, we should receive it in the sweetness of God’s presence. Saint Gregory goes on to say: “Our Lord shows his own works in order to spread out for us the path of following him. Look, in his own meal our Lord wished to add a honeycomb to the broiled fish, because he receives into eternal rest those who in this life eat suffering in their bodies and yet do not depart from the inward love of sweetness. And so the honey is received together with the broiled fish, because those who accept sorrow here for the sake of the truth are there filled with true sweetness.”

From this long saying we can take this short understanding: whoever lovingly endures suffering here for the truth eats the broiled fish with honey. He will be filled with true sweetness when he ends his life in suffering and is seated in everlasting joy.

“These are the words that I spoke to you while I was still with you.” That is: This is the fulfillment of the words I spoke before my death, as in Luke 18:31–33, “Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled. For he will be handed over to the Gentiles, mocked, beaten, and spat on. And after they have flogged him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise from the dead.” These are the words Christ now says have been fulfilled—words he spoke while still with them in his mortal life.

The angel also reminded the women of this when they were seeking the dead one in the tomb. As Saint Luke writes (Luke 24:5–7), the angel said to them, “Why are you looking for the living among the dead? He is not here, but has arisen. Remember how he spoke to you while he was still in Galilee, saying that the Son of Man must be handed over into the hands of sinful people and must be crucified and on the third day rise from the dead.” The angel reminded them, and they remembered at once. Right after that we read (Luke 24:8–9): “And they remembered his words, and returning from the tomb, they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.”

All these things had to be fulfilled, not by chance, but by God’s free will, “for they are written about me in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and in the Psalms.” With these three titles Christ, the great Teacher, sums up the whole Old Testament. The Law of Moses, that is, the Law given by God through Moses, are the books that contain the commandments. The prophetic books are those that contain revelations. And the Psalms are the books that contain commandments, revelations, and prayers.

So the Law of Moses—the five books—show what we are to do. The prophets show what we are to believe. And the Psalms show what we are to pray, so that we may both believe rightly and do what God commands.

Since the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms all speak of Christ—what his life was to be like and what was to happen to him—and since all this was spoken by God, it all had to be fulfilled, so that God might be found by us to be truly faithful, a Lord who cannot fail.

The disciples did not understand the Scriptures well enough to believe all this rightly. So they needed a Teacher who could, in one moment, teach them the Scriptures according to his own will.

Therefore Saint Luke says about this Teacher that he “opened their understanding so that they could understand the Scriptures.” This was “then”—that is, after showing them his hands and feet, after eating, and after praising the Scriptures. He “opened their understanding”—that is, he gave them understanding of the Scriptures, which before had been closed to them, just as the understanding of Scripture is closed today to the Jews and to simple Christians.

To strengthen their understanding, Christ continues, saying that “it is written”—that is, as it has just happened—“that Christ had to suffer.” This is written in Daniel 9:26, that Christ shall be cut off. “And that he must rise from the dead on the third day.” This is written by the prophet Hosea (Hosea 6:2), “He will revive us after two days; on the third day he will raise us up.” He will revive us in our Head, in Christ. The resurrection of Christ is our reviving and our resurrection. Therefore Hosea immediately adds (Hosea 6:2–3): “And we will live before his face. We will know and we will follow on to know the Lord.” We will live before his face in heavenly joy when we rise from the dead after our Head, because here, knowing that he suffered for us, we will follow him in suffering.

So Christ says: “And that they should preach in his name”—that is, they should and must preach “in his name,” which is Jesus—that is, Savior, for there is no being saved except through Jesus. There is no other name under heaven by which we may be saved, except this name Jesus (Acts 4:12).

What must be preached? He says: “Repentance,” that is our part, “and forgiveness of sins among all peoples,” that is, to all people. Whoever, then, repents of his sins, God will forgive his sins through the suffering of Jesus Christ.

Here I must say, without delaying: repentance is sorrow for sins that have been allowed, and guarding against them in the future, as Saint Augustine, Gregory, Ambrose, and others say. So the one who truly repents is the one who grieves over his past sins and firmly resolves never again, until death, to commit them. But the one who confesses and then goes back again to the same sins is a mocker of repentance. Saint Isidore says this.

These saints build on the words of Christ, who gave repentance to the adulterous woman when he said (John 8:11), “I do not condemn you; go, and do not sin any more.” There you see he forbade her the will to sin—that is the beginning of repentance. Sorrow is the second part. Then making satisfaction lies in bodily suffering: fasting, prayer, sleeplessness, thirst, hard work in acts of mercy toward our neighbors. These are called the fruits or works of repentance. About them John the Baptist said to the people in his preaching (Luke 3:8), “Produce fruits worthy of repentance.” And our merciful Christ began his preaching in the same way, saying (Matthew 4:17), “Repent.” And again he said to his disciples (Luke 13:3), “Unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.”

Now the minstrels of this world, the false priests, no longer preach that people should do worthy repentance: first leaving their sins in their intentions, then truly grieving over them from the heart, firmly willing not to return to them, and then doing worthy deeds, as I have said. Instead they preach that whoever gives money will receive forgiveness of sins and release from punishments. To make this lie and open simony and greed look less bare, they add that they give these indulgences only to those who confess with their mouths and have contrition in their hearts.

But this part is true in itself: whoever truly grieves over his sins from the heart and confesses them to God and then, if possible, to a priest, God will forgive those sins. Yet where is the “making satisfaction” for sins?

God says through Ezekiel (Ezekiel 18:21–22): “If the wicked turns from all his sins which he has committed and keeps all my commandments and does judgment and righteousness, he shall surely live and shall not die. None of the transgressions which he has committed will be remembered.” Here a sure promise is given to the truly repentant that they have forgiveness of sins. But they must repent of all their sins, grieving over them from the heart and making satisfaction for them: first, after grieving, by keeping the commandments; then by “doing judgment”—that is, judging themselves, recognizing how deeply they have sinned; and by “doing righteousness”—that is, making it right with their neighbor if they have wronged anyone, and making it right toward themselves by suffering as much as they have sinned. For this is just according to Scripture.

But not this: that one man, giving money and having a bit of sorrow, dies and immediately goes to heavenly joy, though he has had many sins; and another man, not giving money, dies and must suffer torment, though he had deeper sorrow and sinned much less than the first. Or imagine two people: one who has lived fifty years in mortal sins, always following his fleshly desires, never repenting; and another who has lived the same time in a good way, never committing a mortal sin. Then the first man, having very little contrition—just enough to wash away the guilt—and giving money to the pope, dies at once; and the second, having deeper sorrow but giving no money, also dies at once, without having made full satisfaction for his small daily sins. Then the first would, according to their preaching, go straight to heavenly joy without any suffering, because of his money; and the second, who had always lived well, would suffer torment because he did not give money to the pope!

Where did the pope get such unequal power? Did Christ pledge that power to him on the basis of money? Christ says (Luke 12:47), “The servant who knew his master’s will and did not do it will be beaten with many blows.” Will the one who lived very badly for fifty years, knowing God’s will and not doing it, suffer nothing at all, just because he gave money to the pope? Then Christ’s words would not be true, that he will be beaten with many blows!

Again: Christ had to suffer and so enter into his glory. But that man, who has lived terribly for fifty years, delighting his flesh as he pleased, will enter into his own glory without suffering anything—straight from fleshly feasts to the eternal feast, bodily and spiritual, in the glory of soul now and of body after the resurrection—just because he gave money?

How could this stand before the justice of God? Saint Jerome says: “It cannot be that someone goes directly from worldly pleasure into the pleasure of blessedness.”

And again, if it were so, then in all who have even the smallest amount of sorrow and confess to these minstrels and give them money, the third part of repentance—making satisfaction for sin—would be destroyed. True repentance has three parts: first, contrition—that is, heartfelt sorrow for sin; second, confession—at least to God, and to a priest if one is available; and third, satisfaction, which can sometimes be great sorrow itself.

But this satisfaction disappears under such indulgences from sins and punishments for all who confess and have even the smallest sorrow and give money. For whoever dies right away after confession, according to their indulgences, must at once go to heaven. And since this is so, then after confession and giving money no one is bound to do any satisfaction through prayer, fasting, almsgiving, or making things right with his neighbor. The proof is this: they say that both sin, guilt, and all punishment are already forgiven to each one of them, so that everyone who dies goes straight to heaven.

Thus it becomes useless for these priests in confession to impose penances of fasting, almsgiving, and prayer, since they say everything is so forgiven that the person will not suffer anything in purgatory, and certainly not here.

So a person could, when confessing, say to the priest: “Dear priest, I will give you this money; I ask you to guarantee that I have not given it in vain.” And the priest says: “You have the pope’s letters for that.” And the man could answer: “I would like something more certain. If only I had a letter from Christ for this—or at least two guarantors: Peter and Paul, who held the same office and never gave such letters and indulgences!”

Surely the priest cannot give such assurance, for he does not even know for himself whether he will go to heaven or to hell; and the pope knows no more than a plowman whether he will be saved or not—unless God chooses to reveal it to him, as he might to a plowman, just as he revealed it to the apostles and other saints. But he did not save them without repentance; rather, through much suffering.

So they did not grant such indulgences, but preached that people should repent of their sins if they wanted to be saved. They warned us to beware of false Christs and false prophets, just as Christ himself warns (Matthew 24:11), and after him Saint Peter (2 Peter 2:1): “There were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you.” He then shows who they are, saying that because of them “the way of truth will be blasphemed, and in greed, with fabricated words, they will exploit you” (2 Peter 2:2–3).

Later he says that they “entice unstable souls and have hearts trained in greed; they are children of the curse. They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of Balaam” (2 Peter 2:14–15).

Here Saint Peter describes the greedy ones, foretelling that false prophets will be among us—such as those who say that everyone who gives money and has a contrite heart will immediately, when he dies, be free from sins and punishments. For these prophets the way of truth is a joke. When someone says, “But forgiveness of sins must be given freely, without money, as our Savior says,” they immediately mock him as a fool; or others rage and cry: “That man is a heretic!”

Saint Peter calls them “teachers,” for generally the doctors of canon law and papal decrees are the ones who invent clever phrases to deceive the people. Therefore he says (2 Peter 2:3), “With fabricated words, in their greed, they will exploit you.” Is it not a clever and fabricated phrase to say that whoever gives money will, after a little sorrow and confession, be freed from both sins and punishments, no matter how great a sinner he was before? And is it not a form of trade when they say that whoever wants forgiveness of sins and release from punishment must pay as much money as it would cost him to go or travel to Rome? And that, in this, the pope is showing great mercy in freeing a man from the labor of such a long journey, sending him such a great favor from the fullness of his power, which he claims to have—that he can do whatever he pleases: send whom he wishes to hell and whom he wishes to heaven, forgiving whomever he likes both sins and punishments?

With such words the greedy teachers of Antichrist do business with people. And even if, through the preaching of God’s word, people would repent strongly and not trust such talk, they still seduce the people so that they abandon God’s commandments and trust instead in indulgences and release from punishment through giving money—and so they are deceived.

Therefore God says in Isaiah (Isaiah 3:12), “My people! Those who call you blessed are misleading you and disturb the path of your steps.” They call the people blessed when they say, “You are free from sins and punishments.” For anyone who is truly free from sins and punishments is indeed blessed. So by pronouncing blessings on the people, they deceive them—because what they say is not true. They disturb the path of good conduct—the path of repentance and following Christ and the saints—so that people who otherwise would repent courageously and follow the saints in suffering, give it up.

So Isaiah immediately adds (Isaiah 3:13): “The Lord stands to judge.” Truly, he is ready to judge and give each according to what he deserves. And so will be fulfilled the prophecy (Isaiah 9:16): “Those who call this people blessed will mislead them, and those who are called blessed will be destroyed.” That is, they—the false blessers—deceive these people, and the people are deceived; both will fall into everlasting destruction. As Christ says (Matthew 15:14), “If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”

He said this after saying: “Whatever you might have given to me in support is a ‘gift to God’ for you.” The priests of the Old Testament had taught the people that when a father or mother wanted to receive something from their son or daughter, the children should give them nothing, saying: “Father or mother, it is better that I give it to God as an offering, for that will benefit both you and me for salvation.” In this way they gave offerings to the priests and gave nothing to father or mother, and so, as Christ testifies, they broke God’s commandment: “Honor your father and your mother.” The priests prevented giving, and those who were supposed to give did not.

In the same way now they teach people to give to the priests, telling them they will receive forgiveness of sins and release from punishment. But they do not strongly encourage them to give to a poor father, a poor mother, or other poor people. And the people, like the blind, crawl after them.

But they should know that on the Day of Judgment Christ will say (Matthew 25:34–35): “I was hungry, and you gave me food; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was naked, and you clothed me; I was a stranger, and you welcomed me—come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom.” There you have the real forgiveness of sins and release from punishment. And now you hear why: not because they gave money to the pope for war; not because they ran here and there to indulgence preachers; not because they bargained with priests for forgiveness of sins; but because, as Saint Paul says (Galatians 6:7), “Whatever a person sows, that he will also reap”: from generous sowing, eternal salvation; from the sin of not repenting, eternal condemnation.

Therefore we priests must, repenting of our own sins, preach repentance to all the people, so that they too may repent. For through the name of Jesus they will receive forgiveness of sins. For at the end of this reading Jesus says: “And repentance and forgiveness of sins must be preached in his name among all peoples.”
