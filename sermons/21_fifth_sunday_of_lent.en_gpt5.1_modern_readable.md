# Fifth Sunday of Lent  

St. John, chapter 8, verses 46–59  

At that time Jesus said to the Jewish crowds and to the chief priests, the bishops and the teachers of the law:  

“Who among you can convict me of sin? If I am telling the truth—*si veritatem dico*—why do you not believe me? Whoever is from God by grace hears the words of God. This is why you do not hear, because you are not from God by grace, even though you are his creatures.  

The Jews answered him, “Now we are sure you are a Samaritan—a foreigner from Samaria—and that you have a demon, who tells you our secrets.”  

Jesus answered them, “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me by saying I have a demon. I am not seeking my own praise as you think; there is One who seeks my praise and who will judge you for your sin.  

Truly, truly—most certainly, most surely, most faithfully, by my divinity and by my humanity—I say to you: whoever keeps my word, truly keeps it, will never taste death—that is, eternal condemnation—forever.”  

Then the Jews said, “Now, from what you say, we know you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets died, and yet you say, ‘Whoever keeps my word will never taste death forever.’ Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died, and the prophets, who also died? Who do you make yourself out to be?”  

Jesus answered, “If I glorify—*si glorifico*—or praise myself, my praise is nothing; it is empty. It is my Father who glorifies me, the one you say is your God, though you have not known him with living faith. But I know him—from eternity as God, and in time as man. And if I were to say, ‘I do not know him,’ I would be a liar like you. But I do know him from eternity, and I keep his word, his commandment.  

Abraham, your father according to the flesh—but not according to imitation—rejoiced that he would see my day by faith, the day of my incarnation and my dwelling among you. He saw it by faith, when he offered up his son and when it was said to him, ‘In your offspring all peoples will be blessed’ (Genesis 22:18), and he rejoiced in spirit.”  

Then the Jews said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?”  

Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham was created, I am.”  

Then the Jews took up stones to throw at him, to stone him as a blasphemer. But Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.

A. Our merciful Savior spoke these words shortly before his death. He spoke them both to the common Jewish people and to their prelates—the bishops, the teachers, the scribes—who had already led almost the whole people astray so that they would not confess Christ nor listen to him.  

Yet Christ especially aimed this word against the bishops, priests, and lawyers, for all the poison of sin against Christ flowed out from them.  

From this we learn that we also must preach against prelates who openly live in sin and lead people into scandal—but we must do it in love, in truth, and in good order: for their correction and for the warning of the people, so that the people do not follow them, imagining that if they sin after their example, they are not sinning before God. Just as a blind wanderer thinks he is not wandering.  

And the faithful preacher must begin with their evil, just as Christ did. This is written often in the Scriptures. So God also acted: he punished the sins of the priests before he struck the common people.  

Therefore God says through Ezekiel (Ezekiel 9:6): “Begin at my sanctuary!” And Saint Peter says (1 Peter 4:17): “It is time for judgment to begin at the house of God.”  

The priests are called God’s temple and God’s house, because they are supposed to govern God’s temple and God’s house. They even call themselves “holy Church” and the “pillars of the Church.” And because they are the first who ought to govern rightly, then when they go astray they ought to be the first to be rebuked.  

It is like this: if a wagoner rides a horse badly and guides the wagon so poorly that it is about to tip over, people must shout at the wagoner, not at the wagon—unless someone can grab the wagon and hold it upright so it does not overturn.  

In the same way we must cry out first against the evil prelate or ruler. And if you can grab hold of some person whom that prelate is dragging toward ruin, it is good to help that person so he is not overthrown.  

This is what Christ did. He rebuked the bad bishops, teachers, priests, and lawyers, and he warned the simple people again and again not to let themselves be deceived and turned onto the evil path.  

And because both sides had already been largely overturned—the priests had already drawn the people away from Christ, so that neither group believed in him—Christ now speaks to both sides and gives them reasons why they should believe him.  

So the reading says: “Jesus said to the Jewish crowds and to the chief priests.”  

First, Christ shows that his word is pure truth by proving that he himself is pure from sin. For it cannot be that a vessel that is very clean, with no stain in it, would pour out foul drink. So Christ says in Matthew 12:33: “A good tree cannot bear bad fruit.”  

Our dear Lord Jesus, fully certain of his own purity, lays himself open to the judgment of his enemies and says:

B. “Who among you can convict me of sin?”  

Saint Gregory says here: “Weigh this, dearest brothers, the gentleness of God. He came to forgive sins, and yet he says, ‘Who among you can convict me of sin?’”  

Against this humility of Christ stands the Antichrist and his members. Though they are full of sins, they do not want anyone to rebuke them. They seize for themselves what belongs to God alone: that no one may say a word to them, whatever they do. No one may say, “Why are you doing this?”  

And Antichrist goes further: he forbids preaching that speaks against priests. And the priests themselves insist on this most of all, though they are struck down by great sins—simony and thus greed, pride, and sexual immorality. They will not expose themselves to the congregation, as Christ did, to be rebuked for sin. Above all they fight that they never be rebuked.  

But the humble Jesus says, “Who among you can convict me of sin? If there is anyone, let him step forward and convict me of failing to fulfill God’s law, or of speaking injustice to you in my preaching.”  

Origen says this word of Christ is such an immense declaration of confidence that no mere human being has ever been able—in truth—to say it. Only our Lord Christ alone, who committed no sin.  

Then Christ adds: “If I am telling the truth, why do you not believe me?”  

As if he said: “You cannot convict me in my actions. You cannot find injustice or lie in my words. Why then do you not believe me?”  

There is no deeper first cause than this:

C. “You are not from God.” For “whoever is from God hears God’s words.”  

Understand this: all people are divided into two groups. Some are children of God, and others are children of the devil. From the first human to the last, each person is either a child of God or a child of the devil: a child of God by God’s choice for salvation and now, in time, by grace; a child of the devil by mortal sin, especially by final impenitence.  

Yet in one sense, because everyone is created by God, every person is God’s child. That is why we all say, “Our Father.” Every creature, as it comes from God, is good, coming from the Father of lights.  

But beyond this mere created being, some receive God’s grace. That grace comes through the word of God, so that by grace, hearing God’s word, a person gladly serves God the Father.  

God’s word is truth. It is a movement in the soul from God, stirring a person to love God above all things and serve him gladly. Thus the children of God are also called the children of truth.  

In contrast, the devil’s word—by which his children are born—is a lie. It is a movement in the soul that draws a person to cling to falsehood and turn aside from the path of truth.  

So Christ’s saying is perfectly true: “Whoever is from God hears God’s words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not from God.”  

Saint Gregory says: “Let each one ask himself whether he receives God’s word with the ear of the heart, and he will understand where he belongs. The truth calls us to desire the heavenly homeland, to crush bodily lust, to turn away from worldly praise, not to covet what is another’s, and to give away what is our own. Therefore let everyone weigh himself:

D. Has this voice of God already prevailed in the ear of my heart?” If it has, he will know that he is from God.  

Many people do not want to receive God’s commandment into the ear of the heart. And there are some who hear God’s commandment with their bodily ears, but the desire of their soul does not receive it.  

And there are some who gladly receive the words, even with tears, but after a time of weeping they return to evil. These truly do not hear God’s word, because they do not want to fulfill it in their deeds.  

Therefore, dearest brothers, set your own life before the eyes of your understanding. With careful consideration be afraid of what comes from the mouth of Truth: “Therefore you do not hear, because you are not from God.”  

That is Saint Gregory.  

So Christ’s word has already shown us that a person is not “from God” by grace but rather from the devil by wickedness if he does not hear God’s word with his soul. And we see that it quickly becomes clear who is not from God when the truth is spoken directly to him and he cannot bear it.  

So this adulterous brood, these sons of the devil, conceived in evil thoughts and evil will, answered Jesus and said: “We are certainly right when we say that you are a Samaritan and that you have a demon.”  

By calling him a “Samaritan” they mock his faith, as if he did not have the true faith. The Samaritans were pagans who held some parts of the law with the Jews—like the five books of Moses—and rejected other parts.  

Because Christ at times dealt graciously with Samaritans, like the woman at the well, and showed them mercy, they therefore used “Samaritan” as an insult: “We are right when we say you are a Samaritan,” a half-breed and a heretic—just as now they call me and others “heretic.”  

And when they say, “You have a demon,” they mock him as a sorcerer who serves the devil and works miracles by the devil’s power.  

But Christ, who is true God, hearing such great insults, answers humbly and says, “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father,

E. and you dishonor me.”  

They called him a Samaritan; that he does not deny, because “Samaritan” can be taken to mean “watchman” or “guardian.” And he is indeed the watchman of whom David says (Psalm 127:1): “Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.” So in that good sense he does not deny being a Samaritan.  

But that they said, “You have a demon,” he denies according to their evil intent. For although he has the devil under his power, as Lord and Creator has his servant and his creature, so in that sense he “has” the devil. But they meant that he had a demon whom he served and by whose power he did miracles. That meaning he denies and humbly says, “I do not have a demon.”  

Saint Peter says (1 Peter 2): When they reviled him, he did not revile in return. He did not say to them, “You have a demon!” He did not say, “You are liars!”  

Therefore Saint Gregory says that in Christ’s humble words, “I do not have a demon,” our pride is rebuked. For when we are only slightly provoked, we often pour out more fierce threats than we received. We do all the harm we can, and we threaten with what we cannot actually carry out.  

But see: God endures wrongful insult and does not become angry, nor does he answer with insult—though if he had wished to say, “You have a demon,” he would have spoken the truth. If they had not been full of devilishness, they could not have spoken such evil against God.  

Yet hearing the insult, Truth itself—Christ—did not want even to speak that truth, so that they would not think he spoke only because he was angered and wanted to insult back.  

From this we learn: when others slander us without cause, even if we know their evil deeds, we should at that moment keep silent, so that we do not let good rebuke turn into angry self-defense.  

But because those who love the truth fervently must suffer insults from evil people, our Lord gives us an example of humility in himself and says, “But

F. I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.”  

By saying, “I honor my Father,” he teaches his faithful ones that when they patiently endure insult for God’s sake, they greatly honor God their Father. Disciples of Christ, taught by the whole Holy Trinity, knowing that the more they suffer, the more they honor God and the greater reward they will receive, therefore endure insults gladly and humbly.  

This proves that those do not belong to Christ’s school who, at the slightest accusation—often even when the charge is true—rage, sue, and waste much money. In that crowd are, in general, those students who devote themselves to papal law, but do not learn what Christ commanded.  

Many laypeople are also in that crowd, who for a single word or two—for what is not worth a crust of bread—quarrel until they end up in court. And those who sit in judgment on both sides are usually unjust: one because he accuses wickedly, the other because out of pride he defends himself and will not patiently endure.  

And it is clear that it is a far greater wrong to say to a king or bishop—or even to the true God—“You have a demon; you are a heretic,” than for a knight or squire to say to another, “You are a lout.” Yet foolishly and to the great harm of their goods and their souls they insult and beat one another.  

When Christ says, “You dishonor me,” he shows that the children of the devil have this habit: they do not honor the one who tells them the truth.  

And by saying, “I honor my Father,” he shows that he does not have a demon and that he does his miracles by God’s power. Third, he shows that in all his works he seeks only God’s glory. And by saying, “You have not honored me,” he shows that they belong to the devil; for whoever does not honor Christ is of the devil.  

Nor can the Jews truthfully say that Christ did miracles for empty praise. Seeing all his works, they cannot say that he bent toward worldly pride.  

Therefore Christ at once adds, as man: “I am not seeking my own praise; there is One who seeks and who judges.”  

He means: as a man I do not seek praise for myself against the will of God, as worldly people do. But God—my divine nature—seeks Christ’s praise, and from eternity judges what praise is fitting for Christ as man.

G. Therefore, the one who seeks praise for himself in this world is like a man who wants to grab his own shadow in front of him and order it to walk ahead of him against the sun; or like a man who wants to sail great mountains across the water.  

Whoever wants to come to the eternal Sun, Christ, across all the mountains of this world, must leave praise behind him like a shadow—must sweep it away, just as Christ rejected it when he said, “I am not seeking my own praise; there is One who seeks and who will judge you,” because you insult me while you boast of yourselves.  

With these words he entrusts his case to God, that God may judge the wrong they have done him. Although he could have avenged himself at once, he teaches us by his example to leave judgment to God and not take revenge when people harm us.  

And when the wickedness of evil people increases, the preaching of God’s word must not decrease, but must increase, as Saint Gregory says here. Our Savior teaches us this by his own example. After they said to him, “You have a demon,” he did not at once stop preaching his word. Instead he increased and exalted his preaching, saying, “Truly, truly I say to you, whoever keeps my word

H. will never taste death forever.”  

By “death” he means the second death, which follows bodily death: eternal damnation. That is, separation from the life in which the soul would live in God’s grace and joy. That death, as David the prophet says, is the worst of all, for he says (Psalm 34:22): “The death of sinners is the worst.”  

But as good people, when they are insulted, become even better, so the wicked, even if you do them good, only become more offended—especially when you admonish them with God’s word.  

So the Jews, hearing Christ’s very good teaching, were even more offended and said, “Now we know you have a demon!” They try to prove this from Christ’s words, as if he had failed, saying, “Abraham died, and the prophets died, and you say, ‘Whoever keeps my word will never taste death forever.’ Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died. Who do you make yourself to be?”  

In effect they say: “Since Abraham—who is more worthy than you—died, and the prophets—who also spoke God’s word—died, and yet you say that whoever keeps your word will never taste death forever, then you are putting yourself above them.”  

Saint Gregory says: They clung to eternal death, and yet they did not recognize that death. Because they looked only at bodily death, they were blinded to the word of truth when they said, “Abraham our father died.”  

Where did this come from, that they did not understand Christ’s word

I. about eternal death, but twisted it to bodily death?  

Saint Gregory has already shown: because they belonged to that eternal death, their error came from their own wickedness. Scripture says (Sapientia 2:21): “Their wickedness blinded them”—that is, blinded their mind.  

Therefore Aristotle says in *Ethics* 3: “Every wicked person is unlearned.” For because he is wicked, he does evil deeds. And whoever does evil, goes astray. Whoever goes astray does not know what he is doing. And whoever does not know what he is doing is unlearned.  

So our dear Savior prayed to the Father when they were crucifying him (Luke 23:34): “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”  

Did they really not know that they were crucifying him? Or did Christ speak falsely? By no means. But because they did this out of their own wickedness and in blindness, their minds were darkened. Therefore they did not know that what they were doing was evil.  

So also here: they insult Christ and do not understand that he is speaking of eternal death.  

They also do not understand that it especially belongs to Christ to speak of eternal death. He came into the world for this, and was to suffer on the cross, to redeem us from that death.  

Which of them did not know that Abraham and the others died bodily? But the saints did not die the eternal death. They never tasted it. No one can die that death without tasting it forever—that is, without claiming it and experiencing it as his own.  

So when the Jews say, “Are you greater than our father Abraham?” they actually speak truth, though in error, thinking he is not greater than Abraham or the prophets. Therefore they add, “Who do you make yourself to be,” that you exalt yourself above them?  

Christ answers this lying accusation and says, “If I boast, if I glorify myself, my praise is nothing.” For empty praise, because it is against the truth, is not praise but rather shame. But the one whom God praises has true praise, and that is something indeed.  

Therefore Christ says, “It is my Father who glorifies me, the one you say is your God”—but you say this falsely, whereas I say it truly—“for you have not known him” with true faith, since you do not know me. “But I know him,” as man, by perfectly keeping his commandments.  

You say that he is your God especially because you claim to keep his law. “And if I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar

J. like you.”  

They lied when they said they knew God and especially belonged to him because they kept his law. In that they lied. They also lied when they said that Christ had a demon and that he boasted of himself.  

Therefore, if Christ had said, “I do not know God,” he would have been a liar like them.  

K. And because they considered Abraham greater than Christ and falsely honored Abraham above him, the merciful Teacher, wishing to lead them out of this error, says, “Abraham your father rejoiced that he would see my day; he saw it and was glad.”  

Here Christ proves that he is greater than Abraham, their father. But they resist his proof and say it is not so, saying, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?”  

As if they said, “You are not telling the truth. Abraham died more than fifty years ago, and you are not yet fifty.”  

They name the number fifty to press the point: if he wanted to make himself old for honor’s sake, his young appearance would obviously stand against him, for Christ had not yet reached thirty-three years.  

But Christ reveals his divinity, by which he is more worthy than Abraham, and thus also as man. He says, “Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.”  

Notice this: Abraham began to be when he was created; he was not man from eternity. But Christ, because he is God, did not begin to be—he is from everlasting. Therefore he does not say, “I was before Abraham,” but, “Before Abraham was, I am.”  

Here Christ has placed a deep meaning, which in our language, if I tried to explain it fully, the simple would not understand, and our Czech tongue is too short for it.  

Then, when the Jews saw that arguments did not support their error, they turned to stones. They tried to defeat with stones the one whom they could not overcome with words, and they wanted to stone him as a heretic and blasphemer, whose truth they had not recognized.  

So the reading says: “Then the Jews took up stones to throw at him,” to stone him. “But Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.”  

Why did he hide himself from them, when he could have struck them down in an instant? For this reason:

L. To teach us that sometimes, even when we can overpower the proud, we should humbly step back from their anger.  

As Saint Gregory says, Christ hid himself to show that Truth hides itself from those who threaten it. When Truth finds a proud heart, it hides itself from that heart.  

How many there are who criticize the hardness of the Jews for not listening to Christ’s preaching—yet they are like those very Jews. The Jews were hard toward believing; these people are hard toward doing. They hear God’s commandments, they admit his miracles, yet they will not turn from their sins.  

Behold, he calls—and we will not return. Behold, he waits—and we do not care about his patience.  

Therefore, while there is still time, brothers, each one must leave his evil and tremble at God’s patience, so that he understands that he will not be able to escape from him when he comes in wrath, the One who now threatens the gentle.  

So speaks Saint Gregory.  

M. This reading shows us the wickedness of the priests and lawyers of the Jews, as has been said, and more: that against their own law they wanted to stone Christ as a blasphemous heretic—without proper accusation, without witnesses, without legal judgment, and not outside the city, but in the holy place itself.  

Yet their law commanded that after condemning a blasphemer they take him outside the city and stone him there (Leviticus 24:23).  

This same custom the students and priests of the Prague cathedral on the castle have followed: when faithful Christians, from a good desire, admonished priests not to lie in their preaching, they grabbed them right there in the church, beat them, tore their clothes, slapped them, and dragged them into the students’ hall to whip them.  

The monks did the same at Our Lady of the Snows in the New Town, and in other monasteries. And all this comes from greed—just as in those who wanted to stone Christ and later fulfilled their intent, thinking that by scourging, spitting on him, torturing, and insulting him, they had destroyed him.  

But what they feared came upon them: they feared losing their goods—and they did lose them, and with them their souls.  

So too under the new covenant, this will happen to those unworthy priests who, for their greed that rules in God’s temple, slaughter there the members of Christ—those who faithfully admonish them. They murder them right in the church.  

If a layman were to give just one of them a cuff on the nose, they would at once say that God’s temple had been defiled. But when they themselves beat someone until the church is stained with blood, that “does no harm.” And when they secretly commit many other horrible offenses, that is nothing!  

But the King and Bishop with the scourge is coming—Christ—who will drive them out and say to them (Matthew 21:13): “My house is a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers,” by your simony, your greed, your vain talk, your lack of discipline, and your fornication.  

He will drive them out with a more terrible scourge than he used on those Jewish priests, for he will lay this whip on them: “Out, you shameless dogs, who have turned my house into a den of robbers, and have murdered my faithful ones.”
