title: Eleventh Sunday After Holy Trinity
---

Jan Hus's sermon for the Eleventh Sunday after Holy Trinity focuses on Jesus' parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector (Luke 18:9-14), contrasting pride and humility in prayer. He emphasizes that true righteousness comes from humble repentance, not self-exaltation or judging others.

### Key Points:
1. **Two Men Praying**:
   - The Pharisee boasts of his fasting and tithing while condemning others
   - The tax collector humbly confesses his sin, asking for mercy
2. **Lessons on Prayer**:
   - The Pharisee's prayer was rejected because:
     1. He exalted himself
     2. He judged others
     3. He lacked true repentance
   - The tax collector's prayer was accepted because:
     1. He acknowledged his sin
     2. He felt shame
     3. He grieved over his sin
     4. He prayed briefly and sincerely
3. **Humility vs. Pride**:
   - "Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted" (Luke 18:14)
   - Pride corrupts even good deeds when done with wrong motives
   - True worship requires:
     - Pure heart
     - Focused mind
     - Sincere words
     - Understanding of what is prayed
4. **Warning Against Hypocrisy**:
   - The church should be for prayer and God's praise, not greed or vanity
   - Those who misuse God's house for selfish gain make it "a den of thieves"

> **Key Quote**:  
> "God! Be merciful to me, a sinner!" (Luke 18:13). Whoever confesses and prays like this tax collector with such a heart will certainly receive God's mercy.
