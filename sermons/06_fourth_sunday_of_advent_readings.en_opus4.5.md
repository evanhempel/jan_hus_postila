### READING FOR THE FOURTH SUNDAY IN ADVENT
Saint John writes in chapter 1, verses 19-26.

At that time the Jews sent priests and deacons from Jerusalem to John to question him, saying: "Who are you?" And he confessed (that he was not Christ) and did not deny (what he was); and he confessed, saying: "I am not Christ." And they asked him: "What then? Are you Elijah?" And he answered: "I am not (that Elijah in person, as you are asking)!" "Are you the prophet?" And he answered: "No (that is, I am not that prophet as you mean)!" Then they said to him: "Who are you? So that we may give an answer to those who sent us; what do you say about yourself?" He said: "I am the voice of one crying out (for Christ) in the wilderness (of this world): make straight (by good works) the way of the Lord (God's way), as Isaiah the prophet says (in chapter 40, verse 3)." And those who had been sent were from the scribes (who most opposed the truth); and they asked him and said to him: "Why then do you baptize, since you are not Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?" John answered them, saying: "I baptize in water (that is, I wash with water), but among you has stood (dwelling both according to divinity and according to humanity) one whom you do not know (to be God and Christ); he it is who comes after me (to baptize with the Holy Spirit), he who was made before me (more worthy in dignity according to humanity), whose sandal strap I am not worthy to untie (if he had sandals). These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing."

This holy reading shows the goodness of Saint John and the wickedness of the priests, and thus teaches faithful Christians to follow the goodness of Saint John and not to fall into the wickedness of the priests. John's goodness is shown in his confession of truth and in his humility: he confessed the truth by declaring what he was not, and not denying what he was; he showed humility by saying: "I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness!" The wickedness of the priests, both those who sent and those who were sent, is shown in this: that the life of Saint John was hateful to them, as the reading testifies; for they say: "Why then do you baptize?" And our Savior says in Matthew chapter 11, verse 18: "John came neither eating," that is, meat, "nor drinking," that is, wine, "and they say: 'He has a demon!'" that is, within him.

Secondly, their wickedness is shown in that they were not satisfied with a good answer, but pressed on, saying: "Why then do you baptize, since you are not Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?" Oh, how much of that wickedness today's priests have, who call others who live well "demoniacs"! For when they call them heretics and erring ones, in this they consider them demoniacs. And this the Savior prophesied to his faithful in Matthew chapter 10, verse 25, saying: "Since they call the master of the house a demoniac, how much more the members of his household." And just as they forbade John to baptize, saying: "Why then do you baptize?" so today's priests forbid both preaching and baptizing and celebrating Mass to those who proclaim God's truth. They themselves do not preach the truth directly, so that people would abandon their sins, and they prevent others from doing so; just as those priests did not preach God's law, and they prevented Christ, stopping his mouth, as Saint Luke testifies in chapter 11, verse 53, and cursing those who believed in him, as Saint John testifies in chapter 9, verse 28. Today's priests do the same, sending their messengers both from Rome and from Prague, and obtaining bulls to stop preaching in chapels and to burn books; as happened under Archbishop Zbynek, and as is now happening in the confusions of the Prague archbishopric. Alas! They do not heed that God says in this reading: "Make straight the way of God!" John made it straight: he himself lived well, he showed others the way to salvation, he rebuked them for their sins, and through his preaching he showed them how they ought to live; therefore he also said: "I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, make straight the way of God!"

Here we should note that Saint John humbly confessed his frailty, saying: "I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness," that is: I am called by him who cries out in the wilderness. And so understand that Saint John is God's herald, preaching in the wilderness and calling the people to repentance, saying in Luke chapter 3, verse 8: "Produce fruit worthy of repentance, for the kingdom of heaven has drawn near." And this calling is done by God, who calls to repentance; God calls a person through every creature, as Saint Augustine says in *Confessions*, Book 11: "Heaven and earth and all things that are in heaven and on earth, behold, everywhere they tell me that I should love you, nor do they cease to tell all people, so that they may have no excuse for not loving God." Secondly, God calls in the wilderness of this world, for every person is very frail; therefore he said to Isaiah in chapter 40, verse 6: "Cry out!" And Isaiah said: "What shall I cry?" And God said to him: "Every person is grass, and all his glory is like the flower of the field!" Noting this, Solomon, having been deceived by the vanity of the world, says in Ecclesiastes at the end, chapter 12, verse 8: "Vanity of vanities, and all things are vanity!" That is: a person who gives himself to any things whatsoever, abandoning God, will find nothing but vanity; for all comfort of things will perish for him. Therefore it is necessary for a person to serve God diligently, and to use the things that the Lord God has given him for nothing other than his praise and his own salvation; and so he should first know himself: who is he? what is he like? where is he? and where will he be? Who? A person created by God and redeemed by his blood; and what is he like? Miserable because of sins and unsteady in deeds; and where is he? In a miserable world, which is a true wilderness, full of venomous serpents, that is, priests and other evil slanderers, to whom Saint John and Christ said that they are a brood of vipers. And where will he be? Woe to him if he ends up in eternal fire!

And certainly, if a person often looked into himself and knew himself, then he could know God as well, and many other things for his benefit. Therefore the wise men had written above the doorpost of their school this: "Know yourself!" so that whoever wishes to know wisdom should begin first with himself; for whoever does not rightly know himself, how can he know other things? Saint John, knowing what he was, humbly confessed that he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness; and he knew and declared the dignity of the Savior, saying: "I baptize in water," showing that he after me will baptize; but among you, both as God and also as man, he is, whom you do not know because of your sin and because of your ignorance of prophecy. He it is who comes after me to baptize, preach, and teach, just as after me he was conceived in the womb according to humanity, and after me he was born; he who was made before me: not made according to divinity, nor created first according to humanity, but he who before me and before every person is first in dignity.

Here remember that Christ in his divinity was not made, and that as man he was made after Saint John, yet in dignity he was made first. And John confesses this dignity, saying: "Whose sandal strap I am not worthy to untie." As if he were saying: What wonder is it that he is more worthy than I, whom I know was born after me, but whose mystery of birth I do not fully know? So says Saint Gregory in his homily. And so through the strap by which the sandal is bound to the foot is understood the union of Christ's humanity with his divinity; for the Son of God took upon himself humanity in this likeness: just as first there is the foot, and remaining a foot it takes upon itself the sandal and will be hidden under the sandal, so divinity in the person of the Son of God took upon itself humanity and remained divinity, hidden to bodily eyes under humanity. And John is not worthy to untie this union of divinity with humanity, as he says, humbly confessing his ignorance in this matter: "I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal."

From this saying the black monks argue against the barefoot friars that Christ walked in shoes as they do, saying that John would not have spoken thus about his sandals if he had none; and the barefoot friars argue back against them that Christ walked barefoot as they do, for otherwise at the feast Mary Magdalene could not have washed his feet with her tears. But in this dispute neither the one nor the other has a good argument, and sin remains with both of them, because they do not want to follow the poor Christ without desire for riches; and so, having excessive desire for riches, both have unshod feet in their souls. But Christ, who for our sake undertook poverty, was shod in his mind from desire for temporal riches, and if it pleased him, he sometimes walked in sandals and sometimes barefoot. And this I dare not untie—whether he ever walked in sandals or whether he never did—but it is enough for me that for me, a sinner, he walked on this earth as it pleased him.
