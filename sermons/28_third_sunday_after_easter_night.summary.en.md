This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon on John 16:16-22, where Jesus comforts His disciples about His impending death and resurrection. Hus explains Christ's words about sorrow turning to joy, using the analogy of a woman in childbirth.

- **Key Points:**
  1. Jesus foretells His death ("a little while and you will not see Me") and resurrection ("again a little while and you will see Me").
     - The disciples struggle to understand this paradoxical statement.
  2. Christ contrasts the disciples' temporary grief with the world's (Jews') joy at His death, promising their sorrow will turn to eternal joy.
  3. Hus compares Christ's suffering to a woman in labor:
     - Just as pain gives way to joy at childbirth, Christ's death brings forth the Church (spiritual birth).
  4. The resurrection confirms this joy, which no one can take away (John 16:22).
  5. Hus emphasizes that earthly suffering is brief compared to eternal joy, citing Psalm 90:4 and Mark 10:29-30.

> **Key Quote:**  
> *"Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy."* (John 16:20)
