### Reading For The Third Sunday In Advent
St. Matthew, chapter 11, verses 2–10.

At that time, when John, in chains, heard of the deeds of Christ, he sent two of his disciples and said to him (Jesus): Are you he who is to come [to redeem], or are we to wait for another? And Jesus answered and said to them [John’s disciples]: Go and tell John the things you have heard and seen: the blind see [being healed], the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise, the poor are helped forward by God’s word [evangelisantur, that is: they hear God’s word and prosper by it]; and blessed is he [that is], who is not offended [by unbelief] because of me. And when they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? a reed shaken by the wind (that is, not a man whom pride shakes or fickleness)? And what did you go out to see? a man clothed in soft [garments] [though he walks in rough cloth]? Behold, those who wear soft [garments] are in kings’ houses [as the proud and pleasure-seeking]. And what did you go out to see? a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is truly he of whom it is written [the prophet Malachi writes in chapter 3, verse 1]: Behold, I send my angel (that is, messenger: angelus in Greek, posel in Czech) before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.

In this reading there is mention of the imprisonment of Saint John, Christ’s baptizer; second, of the wondrous deeds of the Lord Jesus Christ; third, of the praise of Saint John. Of the imprisonment the reading says: “When John in chains heard of the deeds of Christ.” Know, then, that Saint John was in chains in prison because he rebuked King Herod for adultery, as Saint Matthew writes in chapter 14, verses 3–4, saying: Herod had seized John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother’s wife; for John said to him: It is not lawful for you to have her. And Saint Mark says in chapter 6, verse 20: Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he guarded him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and he gladly listened to him. Why? Saint John Chrysostom says in a sermon about Saint John: John the baptizer spoke what belonged to the law, what belonged to righteousness, what belonged to salvation; surely he spoke not out of hatred, but out of love. And again he says: John admonished Herod with holy admonitions, not with accusation, as a hater of unchastity, wishing him to be saved and not damned. But because few leave fornication easily, Herod did not want to leave fornication or abandon the adulterous harlot; therefore he put John in chains and cast him into prison. And he, being in chains, hearing of Christ’s deeds, sent his disciples to him. Therefore the reading says: “When John in chains heard of the deeds of Christ, he sent two of his disciples and said to him: Are you he who is to come, or do we wait for another?” Know here that Saint John does not doubt whether Christ is the one who has come to take away the sins of the world; for earlier he confessed, saying, John 1:29: “Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world!” And he knew him while still in his mother’s womb and rejoiced; and when he baptized him, he heard the testimony from God the Father that he is his beloved Son whom we are to obey. But Saint John asked because he had care for his disciples and for other people, that they would not doubt Christ, but would believe in him, obey him, and in the end follow him. And therefore he instructed his disciples to ask Christ, saying: Are you he who is to come as the promised Redeemer, or do we wait for another?

And the reading continues: “And Jesus answered and said to them: Go and tell John the things you have heard and seen.” For as Saint Luke writes in chapter 7, verse 21, at that hour he healed many of diseases and wounds and evil spirits, and to many blind he gave sight. And answering, he said to them: Go and tell John the things you have heard in preaching, and seen in wondrous deeds. Here Saint Ambrose says: The Lord answers more readily with his deeds than with words. And Saint Jerome says: Let words be silent; let deeds speak. And so the merciful Savior gave instruction—not to John, but to his disciples—that they would believe that he is the one they were waiting for: that he would come, take away sins, and deliver from damnation. And to show that he is the one, healing many, he says: “The blind see,” and so on.

Know that by “the blind” are meant those who sin out of folly; by “the lame,” those who do partly evil and partly good; by “the lepers,” those who sin out of great desire; by “the deaf,” those hardened in wickedness; by “the dead,” those who sin out of great habit. And all these now, by the grace of our Savior, can be healed—and many have already been healed—so that those who sinned out of folly now see, knowing what sin is and how they were blinded by sin; then the lame, who lived partly evil and partly good, now live steadily in good; and the lepers, defiled by sin through desire, are now clean; and the deaf, who were careless toward the word of God, now gladly listen to it; and the dead—that is, those who had died in soul through mortal sin and sinned by habit—these now rise from that habit. And in these five spiritual matters there is a greater wonder than in bodily healings, and God’s grace is more splendid in these than in those.

And then the dear Savior set down a sixth wonder, saying: “The poor are helped forward by God’s word,” in Latin: evangelisantur, that is: they partake of the reading, which is God’s word, and so they profit both themselves and others—they themselves listen and they teach others. “The poor,” understand: the humble in spirit—these profit by God’s word.

Know here that by the preaching of God’s word the mind is enlightened; second, desire is set in order; evil desire is quenched; hardness in wickedness is broken; sin is driven out; and God’s grace bears fruit in a person. From this know that whoever, hearing God’s word, feels none of these six benefits in himself has a sign that he listens to God’s word without profit. O blessed poor in spirit, to whom the Savior is sent to preach! As he himself says through Isaiah, Isaiah 61:1–2, Luke 4:18–19: That I might proclaim to the meek, he sent me; that I might heal the broken in heart; and that I might declare forgiveness to the prisoners, and opening to the shut-in; and that I might preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

Further, the Savior says in the reading: “And blessed is he who is not offended because of me!” Know that people are offended at Christ in different ways. Some are offended at his mercy, saying that he does not avenge when he ought to avenge, or that he avenges when he ought not to avenge. Of the first they say, as Habakkuk says in chapter 1, verse 13: Why do you not look upon those who do evil? that is, why do you not take vengeance? Of the second that lazy servant said, Matthew chapter 25, verse 24: I know you are a harsh man! Some are offended at his wisdom, thinking he does something he ought not to do; like those who curse the weather, or those who think they could have devised it better than God has made it. And so they marvel that it goes well for the wicked, saying Jeremiah’s word in chapter 15: Why is the way of the wicked prosperous? that is, why does it go for the wicked according to their will? Some are offended because they do not want to suffer with him, as his disciples were offended, to whom he said, Matthew 26:31: You will all be offended because of me! Some are offended at his poverty, as commonly the priests are who do not want to be willingly poor; so that young man was offended who went away from Christ sorrowing when he said to him, Matthew 19:21: Go, sell all that you have, and give to the poor, and follow me. Some are offended at his speech, saying with the Jews in John chapter 6, verse 60: This saying is hard—who can listen to it? And so all are offended who do not keep his commandments, thinking them heavy. And thus, generally, whoever does not believe him and in him, and whoever does not do what he commanded, is offended at Christ. Therefore blessed is the one who is not finally offended at him; for though many were offended, yet afterward returning, by his grace they improved.

After that the reading says: “And when they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? a reed shaken by the wind?” As if he said: Do you think John was like a reed, empty within, having no grace of God in himself? and do you suppose flattery shook him, because he sent to me, and fickleness, because he first bore witness to me, saying, John 1:29: Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world—and now says likewise: Are you he, or do we wait for another? Know that he did not move from his witness, as a reed moves before the wind.

Here Saint Gregory speaks thus: A reed, as soon as the wind touches it, is bent to the side. And what is meant by the reed? Bodily desire is meant, which, when favor or rebuke touches it, immediately bends to one side. For if a breeze of favor blows, it rejoices, boasts, and turns itself entirely toward favor; but if a breeze of rebuke blows from where the breeze of praise had been blowing, then at once it turns to anger. But John was not a reed shaken by the wind: neither did the favor of praise make him a flatterer, nor did anyone’s anger make him cruel; neither did prosperous things lift him up into pride, nor did adverse things cast him down from virtue. Therefore he was not a reed shaken by the wind, for nothing moved him from uprightness of state.

Therefore let us learn, most beloved, that we not be a reed shaken by the wind. Let us strengthen our purpose, set amid the winds of tongues. Let the state of our mind stand without wavering: let no reviling stir us to anger; let no unstable favor bend us toward favor; let adverse things not confuse us—so that we, who are established in the steadfastness of faith, might not be moved by the unsteadfast things of this world. Thus Saint Gregory. Briefly understand it: do not let yourself be moved by flattery into pride, nor by reviling into anger, nor by good fortune into the sin of pride or pleasure, nor let yourself be moved by adversity—such as poverty or some other thing—into impatience. If you stand so, then you will not be a reed shaken by the wind, and you will be worthy for Christ to praise you as he praised Saint John.

Further Christ says: “And what did you go out to see? a man clothed in soft garments?” As if he said: John is no flatterer. For if he wished to flatter, he would not have lived in the wilderness, nor would he have sat in rough cloth while in Herod’s prison. If he wished to flatter, then he would flatter kings, not me who am poor; for those who want to walk in soft and fine clothing are in kings’ houses and flatter.

Oh, how many flatterers there are, and especially priests at the courts of princes, of kings, and of lords—and especially at the papal court! to it the greatest flatterers crawl, and pray and bow more than to the Lord God. And they do all this so that they may walk in soft clothing and expensive dress, and so that they may bear fruit of pride, pleasure, and greed. Truly they have wandered far from John’s life! And woe to us who do not want to suffer, and, living softly, want to be saved! Woe to those who wear proud clothing for vainglory, who cut it in strange ways, who have much of it—so much that moths consume as much or more of it than they do! And Saint James the apostle rebukes such people, saying in chapter 5, verses 1–3: Now weep, you rich, and wail, lamenting over your miseries that are coming upon you! Your riches have rotted, and your garments have been eaten by moths; your gold and silver have rusted, and the rust will be for you as testimony, and will devour your flesh like fire! Remembering this, wise people do not heap up expensive clothing for themselves; but as they can decently cover shame and drive away cold and serve the body’s need, so they use clothing. For for these things clothing was given by God to Eve and Adam when they sinned: for he gave them a wreath to cover shame, and a coat of skins to guard against cold. Behold, John had rough cloth, by which he equally drove away both shame and cold. Therefore the Savior praises him, that he does not walk in soft clothing.

Then the reading says: “And what did you go out to see? a prophet?” As if he said that John does not keep silence out of envy, as if he wished to be called a prophet above me. Therefore: “Yes, I tell you, he is greater than any other prophet, for he is the one of whom it is written: Behold, I send my angel before your face.” This word is the word of God the Father to the Son. For God the Father sent John before Christ his Son, so that he would preach first, baptize first, die first for preaching, and thus make the way ready for the people, that they might know Christ and believe in him.

Therefore he said to the priests of Jerusalem, in Saint John, chapter 1, verses 26–27: I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you do not know: he is the one who comes after me, the one who was made before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to untie. And so John was sent from God so that before Christ—as man—he would preach first, baptize first, and first prepare a way for the people. And that way is the way of Christ, on which he went after John, to baptize us, to rid us of sins, and finally—if we are good—to give us by grace eternal life.
