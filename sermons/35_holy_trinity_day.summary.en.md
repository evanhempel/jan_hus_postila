---

This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon for Holy Trinity Day, focusing on the dialogue between Jesus and Nicodemus about spiritual rebirth and the nature of the Holy Trinity. The full text explores deep theological concepts in Hus's characteristic style.

### Key Points:
- **Nicodemus's Inquiry**: A Jewish leader seeks Jesus at night, acknowledging His divine authority but struggling to understand rebirth.
  - Jesus emphasizes rebirth through "water and the Spirit" (John 3:5) as essential for entering God’s kingdom.
- **Holy Trinity Explained**: Hus clarifies the Trinity as three eternal persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) in one God.
  - Each person is equally powerful, wise, and good, though distinct:
    - Father: Associated with power.
    - Son: Embodies wisdom.
    - Holy Spirit: Represents love/goodness.
- **Human Likeness to the Trinity**: The soul mirrors the Trinity through its faculties:
  - Memory (Father), understanding (Son), and will (Holy Spirit).
- **Baptism’s Role**: Threefold baptism:
  1. Water (physical sacrament).
  2. Blood (martyrdom for Christ).
  3. Spirit (faith-driven cleansing).
- **Christ’s Crucifixion**: Parallels Moses’ bronze serpent (Numbers 21): faith in Christ’s sacrifice delivers from eternal death.

### Key Quote:
> "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life."  
> — *John 3:14-15* (Hus’s emphasis on Christ’s redemptive work)
