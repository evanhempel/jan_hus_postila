This summary covers Jan Hus's sermon on Luke 14:1-11, where Jesus heals a man with dropsy on the Sabbath and teaches humility through a parable about wedding seating. The sermon contrasts Christ's mercy with the hypocrisy of religious leaders.

- **Jesus’s actions**:
  1. Heals a man with dropsy (edema) on the Sabbath, challenging legalistic views.
  2. Uses a parable to teach humility: "Take the lowest seat" to avoid shame (Luke 14:10).
- **Critique of religious leaders**:
  - They prioritize animals over people (Luke 14:5), symbolizing misplaced values.
  - Modern clergy repeat this error, valuing wealth over souls (quoting Bernard of Clairvaux).
- **Key themes**:
  - **Mercy over legalism**: Sabbath healing shows God’s compassion.
  - **Humility**: True honor comes from self-lowering, not self-exaltation (Luke 14:11).
  - **Warning to the proud**: Those who exalt themselves will be humbled.

> **Key quote**:  
> *"For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."* (Luke 14:11)
