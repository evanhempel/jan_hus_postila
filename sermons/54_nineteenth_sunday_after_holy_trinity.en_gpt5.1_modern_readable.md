# Nineteenth Sunday After Holy Trinity

From Matthew 9:1–8

“At that time, Jesus got into a boat, crossed over, and came to his own city. And look, they brought to him a man suffering from gout, lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man suffering: ‘Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven.’ And look, some of the teachers said within themselves: ‘This man is blaspheming.’ And when Jesus saw their thoughts, he said: ‘Why do you think evil things in your hearts? For what is easier to say, “Your sins are forgiven,” or to say, “Get up and walk”? But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins’—then he said to the man who was suffering—‘Get up, pick up your bed, and go to your house.’ And he got up and went to his house. And when the crowds saw it, they were afraid and glorified God, who had given such authority to human beings.”

In this holy Gospel reading we are shown that our gracious Savior was eager and diligent for human salvation—walking from place to place, preaching, and even crossing the sea by boat so that people might be saved.

This reading shows his mercy and his divine power in that he healed the man suffering from gout and forgave his sins. It also shows the malice of the scribes and law-experts, who falsely accused Christ of blasphemy. And although in their hearts they showed hatred toward Christ, still he kindly taught them that he was not blaspheming God, but that he truly has authority to forgive sins.

The reading also touches on the faith of those who carried the man with gout and laid him before Jesus, and the response of the crowds, who glorified God because he had given such power to people to heal the sick.

The text says: “Jesus got into a boat,” that is, to leave the land of the Gerasenes, because they had begged him to go away from them, as we read in Matthew 8:34. They asked him to leave after he had driven demons out of one man and healed him; then, at the demons’ request, he allowed them to enter a herd of pigs, and they drowned the pigs in the sea.

“And he crossed over and came into his own city.” Mark 2:1 names this city *Capernaum*, because that is where he healed the man suffering from gout. Here you should know this: every place is Christ’s, since he is God, and even as man all belongs to him. Yet Scripture gives certain cities a special place in his story. Nazareth is called his city because there he was conceived and raised. Bethlehem is called his city because there he was born. Capernaum is called his city because at the beginning of his preaching he did many miracles there. And Jerusalem is called his city because there he suffered death.

The Gospel continues: “And look, they brought to him”—that is, they set before him so that he might heal—“a man suffering from gout, lying on a bed.” I say “a man suffering from gout” because that seems better than “a man broken” or “a paralyzed man.” I do not know whether he had broken bones, but I do know this: he suffered from gout. Some Czechs would call him “the man with the *pokostnice*,” from a disease called *pokostnice*, which attacks the bones; commonly we call it *gout*.

“And when Jesus saw their faith”—with the inward eye he saw it in their souls, and with his bodily eyes he saw their actions—“their faith,” that is, the faith of those who carefully carried the sick man and laid him before Jesus, “he said to the man suffering: ‘Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven.’”

Here Saint Jerome says: O what great humility! He calls “son” this despised and weak man, struck down in all his limbs, whom the priests did not even want to touch. And Christ’s words are indeed remarkable: that he called him “son,” showing him grace because he forgave his sins; that he says “Take courage,” strengthening him in hope; and that he says, “Your sins are forgiven,” naming the very cause of his sickness.

What a good physician, our merciful Savior! He first heals the soul, and then the body—showing that the disease of the soul is worse than the disease of the body, and that the health of the soul is better than the health of the body.

And note how the Savior says: “Your sins are forgiven,” and he does not say, “I forgive your sins,” so that later priests would not seize on this form and say, “Woman, *I* forgive your sins,” as Saint Augustine explains. Rather, priests should exhort the sinner and say something like: “Son, take courage and be sorry for your sins, and the Lord God will forgive you. For if you truly grieve over your sins, and you intend not to sin again, and you trust God with your whole heart, then your sins are forgiven you by God’s power.”

The Gospel goes on: “And look, some of the teachers…” Mark 2:6 says that some of the law-teachers were sitting there and thinking these things in their hearts. Matthew adds: “Some of the teachers said within themselves”—that is, they thought—“This man is blaspheming!” That means: he is claiming the power of God, even though he is not God.

Understand this: blasphemy happens in three ways.

First, when someone, by opinion or by speech, tries to take away from God what belongs to God. The Jews did this—and even now do this—when they say that Christ is not God. They also blasphemed God in the wilderness, thinking he could not feed them.

Second, there is blasphemy when people attribute to God what does not fit him. For example, if someone thought or said that God could lie, or judge unjustly, or otherwise commit sin. In this way the teachers were now blaspheming Christ when they said, “This man is blaspheming!” They were ascribing to God a sin in Christ—as if he, Christ, could sin, when in truth he cannot sin.

Third, there is blasphemy when what belongs only to God is attributed to some mere creature. For example: to *create* something belongs to God alone. So if anyone said that some created thing could create another thing or being, that person would be blaspheming God.

And in this third kind of blasphemy stand those priests who say that they are creators of their God, and that at the mass they *create* the body of God. That is a lie. They do not create him whom the Virgin Mary bore, for he was created once by God alone and born of the Virgin Mary, and he has never perished and never will. Nor do they create another body of Christ, for he never has, nor ever will have, another body.

To create is to bring something into being that previously did not exist, so that it now exists. In this way God is Creator: he made this world out of nothing—when before it was not so. Therefore we believe in God the almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and we do not believe that priests are creators.

From this you must understand: whoever curses God or deliberately speaks against God is blaspheming God, forcing onto God what does not belong to him. That is why, in the book of *Leviticus* 24:16, God commanded that the whole people should stone such a person, saying: “Whoever curses the name of God shall surely die; all the people shall stone him.”

Now, to forgive sins by one’s *own* power belongs to God alone. So when Christ said, “Your sins are forgiven,” they concluded: “This man is blaspheming”—that is, he is claiming divine power while not being God, because they believed that Christ was not God and that this power to forgive sins belongs to God alone. In this they were wrong about Christ, but they were right that this power belongs to God alone. Yet their sin was greater because Christ did *not* say, “I forgive your sins,” but, “Your sins are forgiven.”

And so every priest may say to a person under this condition: “Dear son, dear brother, if you truly grieve over your sins, if you firmly intend not to sin, and if you put your trust in the Lord God, then your sins are forgiven you by God’s power.” And speaking this way, he does *not* blaspheme God.

The reading continues: “And when Jesus saw their evil thoughts…” Here he clearly shows himself to be God, for by his own power alone he knows all the thoughts of every heart. “He said: ‘Why do you think evil things’”—that is, evil thoughts—“‘in your hearts?’” In other words: you are thinking that I cannot forgive sins and that I am blaspheming God by claiming his power.

“What is easier to say?” It is as if he said: Since you will not credit me with the power of spiritual healing, I will prove it to you by visible bodily healing. “What is easier to say”—understand it this way: that what is said happens immediately by the power of the one who speaks—“‘Your sins are forgiven,’” so that he is healed in his soul, “or to say, ‘Get up and walk,’” so that he is healed in his body?

Know that for God both are equally easy; one is not harder than the other. And no one but God, by his own power, can by a word alone heal both body and soul—though a good person can pray and obtain from God for another person health of body and of soul.

“So that you may know that the Son of Man”—that is, the Son of the Virgin Mary—“has authority on earth to forgive sins…” Here Saint John Chrysostom says: as much as the soul is more noble than the body, that much greater a work it is to forgive sins than to heal the body. Yet from the quick and powerful bodily healing, which happened at his word, they should have taken proof that spiritual healing also happened at his word.

Therefore “he said to the man suffering from gout: ‘Get up’”—that is, rise up, now healed of your sickness—“‘pick up your bed, and go to your house.’ And he got up and went to his house.” Look: both his sins and his sickness left him. Health came both to his soul and to his body, and he obeyed.

“And when the crowds saw it, they were afraid and glorified God, who had given such authority to human beings.” The explanation says: They thought that this man, who worked such mighty deeds among them, had received from God this power, and that God had also given a similar power to others, so that they too healed the sick.

And it is true: God gave this power to Christ as man, and also to other saints, that they might heal people—but not in the same way. Christ heals souls, and so do other saints; but Christ does so in a higher way than they. He heals whom he wills, when he wills, by his own power. The saints heal by asking, by praying, by his word and by his power.

To him, therefore, be praise—now and forever and ever. Amen.
