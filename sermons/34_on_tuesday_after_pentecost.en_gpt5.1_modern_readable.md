# On Tuesday After Pentecost

From St. John, chapter 10, verses 1–10.

At that time Jesus said: “Amen, amen, I tell you for your instruction: whoever does not enter the sheepfold through the door—that is, through me—but climbs in some other way, through pride, greed, or some other disorder, that person is a thief, because he takes what belongs to another, and a robber, because he destroys. But whoever enters through the door—that is, through me—is the true shepherd of the sheep chosen for salvation. To him the gatekeeper—God in Christ—opens. The sheep—the elect—hear his voice, that is, they receive the truth they must believe and obey. He calls his own sheep by name, because he knows them, and he leads them out of their sins. When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice. But they will not follow a stranger; instead they will run away from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers, that is, of lies and the commands of evil men.”

Jesus told them this parable, but they did not understand what he was saying. So Jesus said to them again: “Amen, amen, I tell you: I am the door for the sheep. All who have come—whoever has come in any way not through me—are thieves and robbers. But the sheep did not listen to them. I am the door by which they enter the sheepfold, which is the assembly of the holy elect. Whoever enters through me—enters that assembly—will be saved. He will go in—to grace—and go out—from sin—and will find pasture here in my body, and later in my divinity and my humanity. The thief comes only to steal—to take the pleasures—and to kill his own soul and the souls of others, and to destroy them. But I, the faithful shepherd, have come into the world so that my sheep may have life—holy life in grace—and have it more abundantly in eternal joy.”

Know this: all the sheep together and the sheepfold are one reality, just as the door and the gatekeeper and the shepherd are all Christ.

This holy reading can hardly have a better commentary, because our merciful Savior himself explains what he meant by this parable. He says that he is the door of the sheep, and that whoever enters through him will be saved. All others who have entered or come in any other way than through him are thieves and robbers. But whoever comes in through him is a shepherd of the sheep, to whom the gatekeeper opens.

So, as St. Augustine says about this reading, Christ himself is the shepherd, the door, and the gatekeeper. And he says: “Let us ask that gatekeeper to open our understanding, so that we may understand how he is the shepherd, the door, the gatekeeper, and even a sheep.” (*Sup. Joh.*)

He is the shepherd because he knows his sheep by name. He feeds them, leads them, gives them life, and grants them eternal life—as I wrote already in the 25th sermon. He is the door because no one can enter into God’s grace in this life, nor into eternal life after death, except through him. As he himself says: “I am the door; whoever enters through me will be saved.”

He is the gatekeeper because whoever he opens faith, grace, and the kingdom of heaven to—that person enters. And whoever’s understanding of this Scripture he opens—that person understands.

Christ is also the sheep, because when he was led to death, he went quietly and humbly, and did not open his mouth to curse or to speak in rebellion. Remembering this lovingly, let us consider: when did he speak these words of today’s reading, before whom, and why?

When did he speak them? In the last year of his preaching, shortly before his death, when the priests and scribes had already agreed together that anyone who confessed that he was the Christ should be cast out of the synagogue, as St. John tells us in John 9:22.

Before whom, and to whom, did he speak? St. John shows in that chapter that he spoke before the priests and the scribes—and it is especially to them that he directed these words—and also to all in the future who would enter in the same way they did. But the holy church, when it reads this gospel at Mass, says, “Jesus said to his disciples.” That does not mean he did not also say it to those priests and scribes. Both groups heard his holy words—but they heard in very different ways. The disciples heard as sheep; the priests and scribes heard as thieves and robbers. That is what the Savior, the true shepherd, meant.

Why did he speak like this? He never speaks without purpose. He spoke so that his sheep would learn whom they should listen to and follow, and whom they should beware of. And he wanted to show his deputies, his ministers, the door by which they must enter, so that by entering some other way they would not become thieves and robbers, like those priests and scribes. About them St. Augustine says, *In om.*: “Because the scribes boasted that they could see, though they were blind with poisonous, proud, and incurable boasting, the Lord spoke these words. When they did not understand, he was pleased to explain them to them. In these words, if we are willing to pay attention, he saves us by warning us not to boast in worldly wisdom nor in the dignity of our virtue.” That is Augustine.

He took this mention of pride and boasting from what the scribes had just said to the Lord Jesus in their proud anger, in John 9:40: “Are we blind also?” They thought they were not foolish but wise. They had just spoken to the man who had been born blind and had been healed by Jesus, mocking him because he confessed Christ, John 9:28: “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.” In this they showed their pride in their position, thinking they were more worthy in virtue than Jesus himself. They despised that faithful man, who was one of Christ’s chosen sheep. They despised Christ the shepherd, and while casting out Christ and those who belonged to him, they still considered themselves to be shepherds.

With this holy reading our kind Savior proved to them that they were thieves and robbers—and not only they, but all who enter the sheepfold in any way other than through him. And to make them absolutely sure of this, he says: “Amen, amen, I tell you: whoever does not enter the sheepfold—that is, the assembly of believers—through the door, that is, through me, but climbs in by some other way, that one is a thief and a robber.”

Notice his wording. He says, “does not enter” through the door, “but climbs in some other way.” That means: he climbs upward by pride instead of going low in humility. That one is a thief and a robber.

St. Augustine says: “A thief is someone who calls what belongs to another his own; a robber is someone who kills what he has stolen.”

From this, let anyone who will understand who is a thief among Christians. Every person who comes into the Christian assembly by some way other than through Christ is a thief. And because everyone who lives in mortal sin is coming in some other way than through Christ—who is the first door and the first way—every such person is a thief. He steals from God both praise and honor, and he calls something his own which is not his. He says that Christ is his Father, but he does not want to be an obedient son. He says he eats his own bread, though he is not worthy of it.

As St. Augustine says: because he has been unfaithful to his Lord and has surrendered himself to the devil against Christ, even if with his mouth he lies and claims to stand with Christ, he is like a robber, because he murders what he has stolen. He has taken his soul from God and now holds it like a thief, and he has killed it by mortal sin. So he is both thief and robber.

Our Savior especially had in mind priests and scribes who considered themselves shepherds, and all who walk in their pattern. So every person who, entering by some way other than through Christ, climbs above others to be their shepherd—that person is a thief and a robber. And because Jesus Christ is the door, and he is the truth and the salvation, everyone who enters for any other purpose than salvation, and so enters crookedly, is a thief and a robber.

So St. Augustine says: “Woe to that poor man, for he must fall!” And because those who climb above others into positions of dignity usually rejoice in their promotion, St. Jerome says: “Let us rejoice in being raised up, but let us fear falling; for the joy of dwelling on high is not so great as the sorrow of falling from a great height.” The apostle Judas should weigh those words. He was for a short time an apostle and a bishop in joy, and for more than thirteen hundred and eighty years he has tasted sorrow.

Woe to the thieves and robbers, the deputies of Judas, bishops and other priests, misers and simoniacs and thieves who greedily keep or badly waste the alms of the poor—just as Judas stole. Of him St. John writes in John 12:6 that he “had the money bag and used to steal from what was put into it.”

Such people are thieves and sacrilegious robbers. As St. Bernard says: “The property of churches is certainly the inheritance of the poor, and with sacrilegious cruelty it is torn away from them whenever priests, who are surely not lords nor heirs but only servants and stewards, take anything beyond food and clothing for themselves and their servants.” And again he says: “Granted, whoever labors faithfully and usefully is surely worthy of his reward, that those who serve the altar should live from the altar. I say: live from the altar—so that, as the apostle says (1 Timothy 6:8), ‘Having food and clothing, with these we should be content.’ For it leads surely to ruin if someone, wasting things in vanity, thinks that when the apostle says (1 Corinthians 9:13) they should live from the altar, it means they may live in pride, in fornication, in wealth, or become rich by the priesthood, or build great spacious halls for themselves out of church revenues, turning square buildings into round ones, or pile up moneybags from the altar, or spend church goods on luxuries and excess, or exalt their friends with church money, or give dowries from it to their sisters—let me not even say to their daughters. To give what belongs to the poor to those who are not poor is indeed equal to sacrilegious robbery.” That is all St. Bernard.

And St. Jerome says, *Hier. ad Nepot.*: “How can they be priests, they to whom it is commanded to renounce their own goods? To take what belongs to a friend is theft; to cheat the church is sacrilege; to take what should be given to the poor, and when many are hungry, to insist on being ‘careful’—so that nothing is lost—or ‘cautious’—so that there is never a lack—or even, which is the most obvious sin, to seize those goods for oneself—this exceeds the cruelty of all bandits! Another man dies of hunger and you say his belly is full. Therefore, either immediately share out what you take, or, if you are a fearful steward, hand it over to someone more generous and let him distribute it.” That is all St. Jerome.

See how these two true witnesses of God testify that priests who greedily hold on to church or altar goods are thieves—not the least of thieves, but sacrilegious ones.

Yet they say: “I have nothing beyond what I need. I must have a horse, servants, and a prelate’s fine equipment.” Both saints have already answered them: a priest must not live in pride, nor become richer after taking office than he was before the priesthood.

And again St. Bernard, in one sermon speaking in the person of the poor, says: “The naked cry out, the hungry cry out, they complain and say: What good does the gold on the bridle do? Does it drive out the cold or satisfy hunger, while we suffer miserably with cold and hunger? What good are all those many precious garments hanging on poles or lying in chests? That which is rotting there belongs to us! Our goods, unjustly and cruelly stolen, are those things with which you fill your bellies and feed your idle eyes. By them we, your brothers, God’s heirs, might have fed our stomachs. Your servants walk by well-fed, weighed down with precious stones, silk, and ornaments of gold, while our bare knees shiver in coarse leggings from the cold. Robbing us of our Father’s inheritance, you build for yourselves extravagant houses, store up fine equipment, and feast yourselves.” Thus St. Bernard speaks in the voice of the poor, as their spokesman against spiritual thieves and robbers. Their true spokesman is our beloved Father Jesus, and he will speak about them, bringing charges on the day of judgment against those thieves and robbers. He will say, in Matthew 25:42–43: “I was hungry and you did not feed me; I was thirsty and you did not give me drink; I was naked and you did not clothe me.” And the thieves and robbers will answer, Matthew 25:44–46: “When did we see you hungry or thirsty or naked and did not help you?” The King Jesus will answer them: “Whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me. Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire.” Ah, how much heavier that condemnation will be than any punishment now given to thieves and robbers!

So woe to anyone who enters in any way other than through Christ. He who cannot fail has said that whoever climbs in some other way is a thief and a robber.

St. John Chrysostom says: “You have heard how he describes the robber; now see how he describes the shepherd, for he says, ‘He who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.’”

St. Augustine explains, *De verb. Dom.*: “He enters by the door who enters through Christ; who follows the suffering of Christ; who understands the humility of Christ. Since God became man for us, man should recognize that he is not God but man. For the one who, being only a man, wants to be seen as God does not follow him who, being God, became man.” That is Augustine.

If only those who call themselves “gods” out of pride would weigh this. People bow to them, kiss their feet, call them “most holy.” If only they would come to their senses and accept for themselves the suffering and humility of Jesus! But their lesser little robbers, their flattering followers, will not allow them. They push them to enter the sheepfold in ways Christ does not desire and will not open to.

But Jesus, the gatekeeper and the door, opens to the one who, moved by God and already made ready in virtue, desires above all the glory of God and the benefit of the holy church, which is the assembly of those elect to salvation, and thirdly desires his own salvation, and works steadfastly for those three things. Christ opens to such a one.

But the one who enters ministry while living wickedly—proudly, greedily, or in sexual sin—even if he is given office or elected to it, enters in another way. No one becomes a true shepherd just because people have given him office or chosen him. Only the one whom God chooses, and to whom Christ the gatekeeper opens, and who receives that office in grace—that one is the shepherd who has entered through the door, as long as he follows Christ the Shepherd.

Again, anyone who enters by greed, by simony, by violence, or by some crafty trick, so that he may be rich, honored, and live a life of pleasure—that one is climbing in another way. He becomes a robber and thief in three steps. First in his entrance, because he entered wrongly. Second in his holding of the office, because he holds it wrongly. And third in his exit, when he dies without repentance, or when he hands over the office to another for money, or out of fleshly favor more than for the good of souls and the glory of God.

On the other hand, the one who lives well and is called, and accepts office first of all for the glory of God, then for the benefit of the holy church, and then for his own salvation—that one is a shepherd in his entrance. If he continues in that way, he is a shepherd in his conduct. And if he dies while still advancing in that, he dies as a good shepherd.

About such a shepherd Christ says: “He who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the gatekeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them.”

This shepherd is Christ himself, as St. Augustine and St. John Chrysostom explain. He is the shepherd who did not throw himself into the flock out of pride and foolish ambition. The Father, God himself, chose him to be shepherd of the sheep—that is, of those chosen for salvation, as St. Augustine says.

He entered “through the door” because, being God, he humbled himself to become truly human, so that he might obey the Father and serve the sheep all the way to death—not an easy death, but the most shameful and cruel.

So for him “the gatekeeper”—God—“opens,” and “the sheep”—that is, those elected to salvation—“hear his voice,” that is, the truth they must believe and carry out in deeds. They “hear” it by keeping it firmly with the inner ear of the heart.

“He calls his own sheep”—the elect—“by name.” Augustine says: “He knows the names of the elect.” That is why he said to his disciples in Luke 10:20: “Rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”

“And he leads them out” of their sins by inward calling, by teaching from Scripture, by his example, and by his work of redemption. St. John Chrysostom says: “He led the sheep out when he sent them—not out away from wolves, but into the midst of wolves.”

“And when he has brought out all his own,” that is, released them from their sins—Augustine says: “Who else releases the sheep except the one who forgives their sins, so that, freed from cruel chains, they may follow him?”—“he goes ahead of them.” Augustine continues: “Who is it that has gone before the sheep, except the one who, having risen from the dead, no longer dies, and who said to the Father (John 17:24): ‘Those you have given me, I want them to be with me where I am’?”

So Christ has shown that he is the highest shepherd. The sheep are his by creation, because he is God; by purchase, because as man he bought them with his blood; and then by feeding, guarding, healing, and finally by giving them rich, overflowing pasture. They are not the sheep of anyone else, as St. Augustine says.

That is why he said to Peter in John 21:17, “Feed my sheep!”—not, “Feed your sheep.” Therefore Peter and the other apostles and saints never said to people, “You are my sheep.” Instead Peter wrote to Christians in 1 Peter 2:21: “Christ suffered for us, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps.” And later, 1 Peter 2:25: “You were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.”

Look: it is to the Shepherd of souls, the Lord Christ, that the sheep are drawn—not to Peter or any other as to the first shepherd. But you may say: “How then can others besides Christ be called true shepherds, if the sheep are not theirs?” I answer: they are called true shepherds because Christ the gatekeeper has opened to them, and through him they have entered, and they feed his sheep. They go ahead of them with good works, they lead them out of sin by God’s word, they lead them into virtue, and they keep them listening to the voice of their true Shepherd, Jesus Christ.

Now Christ goes on to speak about the sheep: “The sheep follow him,” that is, the elect follow Christ in virtue. “Because they know his voice,” that is, the truth they must believe and obey. “But they will not follow a stranger.”

A stranger is anyone who lives differently, or teaches differently, than Christ commands. Yet even if a man is a stranger by his evil life, if he speaks with the voice of Christ the Shepherd, the sheep must hear that voice—but they must not follow his evil deeds. That is why Christ says: “They will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him,” meaning, they will not consent to his evil. “For they do not know,” that is, they do not want to know in a way that means consenting—“the voice of strangers.”

The stranger is Antichrist. The stranger is every ruler who commands anything against the voice of Christ. The priests, scribes, and teachers who tried to turn the healed blind man away from Christ with their own voice were strangers. But because that man born blind was in truth Christ’s sheep, he did not listen to the voice of strangers, but held firmly to the voice of his Shepherd, Christ, and followed him.

There are three signs that show whether someone is Christ’s sheep.

First: the sheep gladly hear Christ’s voice—that is, the truth they must believe and obey.

Second: they follow Christ in virtue—in humility, gentleness, chastity, moderation, justice, and perseverance to death.

Third: they do not follow strangers, but instead keep away from them. They do not want to know their voice in the sense of consenting to it.

By these marks, person, examine yourself to see whether you are Christ’s sheep.

The reading continues: “Jesus told them this parable”—to the scribes, priests, and his disciples—“but they did not understand what he was saying to them. Then”—that is, for this reason, so that they might understand—“Jesus said to them again, ‘Amen’”—this on his divinity—“‘amen’”—this on his humanity—“‘I tell you: I am the door of the sheep. All who came’”—Augustine says: “apart from me, not through me”—“‘are thieves and robbers.’”

Alas—what a multitude of thieves and robbers! How can Christendom stand, when those who ought to be shepherds are thieves and robbers, and, as Christ says elsewhere in Matthew 7:15, are inwardly ravenous wolves? I have already written about them in the 25th sermon.

Where does this great number come from? St. Bernard says: “They want to be honored; they desire to please people; they want to grow rich and proud; they want to make themselves like this world in everything. Listen to the Lord’s complaint, what the patient Rewarder says about such bold presumption, preferring to ask for repentance rather than to take vengeance.” He quotes Hosea 8:4: “They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I did not know it.” Then Bernard says: “All those in clerical ranks who belong to the temple, but seek their own praise, or wealth, or bodily pleasures, their own delights and not those of Christ—clearly and without any doubt, they are not led by that love which is God, but by a desire far from God, which is the root of all evils. What boldness this is—no, what madness—if there is any fear of God, any memory of death, any fear of hell, and that dreadful expectation of judgment! You do not dare even to enter the king’s bedchamber or private room unless the king himself leads you in; you tremble even when you are led. And yet everyone pushes himself forward, drawn by his own pleasure, seeking shameful gain, thinking it good, though it certainly leads to damnation.” That is all St. Bernard.

He ends very harshly: “Certain is their damnation”—that is, unless they repent.

And how should they repent? St. Gregory shows this, saying, *In reg.*: “Whoever does not shine with holy conduct, and is not called from the ranks of the disciples and the community, nor urged by the entreaties of others, but without shame reaches for the priesthood of Christ while stained by some sin, by unjust desires of the heart, or by impure requests of the mouth, or who obtains the dignity of bishop or priest by worldly power, or by bodily service, or by deceitful gifts—not for the profit of souls but for empty boasting—and during his life does not willingly give it up, and if death finds him without harsh repentance, will without doubt perish forever.” Thus Gregory shows what repentance is needed for those who enter bishoprics and other spiritual offices improperly: everyone of that kind, who does not willingly renounce his office and then also repent harshly before death, will perish eternally.

So consider this: when will all thieves and robbers repent? And because they are thieves who have taken what belongs to others, and could return it, let them return it, as St. Gregory teaches, and repent strongly of their thievery and robbery.

Because such people do no good to the sheep, Christ continues: “But the sheep did not listen to them”—that is, the elect did not obey them in their evil.

Then he says: “I am the door”—by which they enter the sheepfold, which is the assembly of the saints. “Whoever enters through me”—through my will and help—“will be saved, and he will go in”—into grace—“and go out”—from sin—“and will find pasture,” here the pasture of my body in faith, hope, love, and later in heavenly joy the pasture of my divinity and my humanity.

“The thief comes only to steal and to kill and to destroy.” Know that to steal is to take another’s goods without that person’s will. So everyone who enters improperly, as has been described, is a thief, because he takes what belongs to someone else without the will of the highest Lord. Our Savior shows why such people enter: in order to steal—even though they do not say so.

The thief also kills his own soul and the souls of others, leading them into sin by pressure or bad example. So he destroys his own soul and the souls of others.

Those priests who opposed Christ, to whom he spoke this reading even though they would not listen, were such thieves and robbers. And now, all who have not entered through Jesus—who is the door—are the same.

But he says: “I”—the faithful shepherd—“did not come to steal, kill, and destroy, but I came so that my sheep might have life,” that is, holy life now, “and have it more abundantly” in eternal joy. For now Christ’s sheep have blessedness in hope, but then they will have it in reality. Now they have it with sorrow and toil; then they will have it without sorrow and without toil, through their shepherd Jesus Christ.

Amen.
