# Reading for the First Sunday in Advent

Matthew writes in chapter 21, verses 1–9: When Jesus came near Jerusalem and reached the village of Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples (Peter and Philip), and said to them: “Go into the town that is in front of you, and right away you will find a donkey tied there, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. And if anyone says anything to you, say: ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will let them go at once.” All this happened to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: “Tell the daughter of Zion” (that is, the people of Jerusalem), “Look, your king is coming to you, gentle, riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.” So the disciples went and did as Jesus had commanded them. They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them. A large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. The crowds who went ahead of him and those who followed behind were shouting: “Hosanna” (that is, “Lord, save us!”) “to the Son of David” (that is, through the Son of David)! “Blessed is he who comes in the name of God!”

**A.** This reading actually happened on Palm Sunday, so in one way it belongs more to that day of remembrance than to today. But we read it today because we are remembering his *coming*—the coming the Christian church begins to remember from this day, which we call “Advent,” taking the word from Latin. In Latin *adventus* means “coming” or “visitation.” And the holy church keeps this in mind from today until the day of Christ’s birth. So this whole stretch of time is called Advent—the time when we remember Christ’s coming, his visitation.

Now understand this: Christ’s visitation is threefold, as Scripture shows.

The first visitation is in the flesh. He visited us in this way when, though he is God, he was conceived and took on flesh in the womb of the Virgin Mary. About this he himself says in John 16:28: “I came out from the Father and I came into the world.”

The second visitation of Christ is spiritual, when he visits us by his grace. For he says in John 14:23: “If anyone loves me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him.” Christ means that he and the Father will come to that person who loves Christ and keeps his words. About this visitation he also says in the Revelation of John, chapter 3, verse 20: “Look, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door for me, I will come in to him, and I will dine with him, and he with me.”

Christ stands at the door in this way: he is ready by his grace to visit the will of a person. And he knocks when he warns and stirs us—by inward prompting, by pain, by fear, by sickness, or by giving various gifts. Whoever hears his voice in his commandments and opens the door to Christ—leaving sin and turning the will fully toward good—to that person Christ comes in and visits him with his grace. And if that person dies in that grace and does not go back to sin, then Christ will dine with him and he with Christ; that is, that person will enjoy the joy of God forever.

So Christ visits a person spiritually when he leaves mortal sins and Christ forgives them, when Christ gives that person some special grace, and when Christ comes to him with grace at the hour of death. And in another way he also visits evil people—with terror, with vengeance, and with eternal condemnation, especially at their death. For Saint Matthew says in chapter 24, verse 42: “Stay awake, because you do not know in what hour your Lord is coming.” And in Revelation 3:3 he says: “If you will not stay awake, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come to you.”

The third visitation of Christ is still to come on the Day of Judgment. About that he himself says in Matthew 25:31–32: “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all his angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his kingdom, and all peoples will be gathered before him.” And about this coming we also confess in the Creed, that he will come to judge the living and the dead.

From this you must understand further: that the first visitation happened once, because he became flesh once. The second happens every day, because every day he visits the faithful with his grace, and the wicked with punishment or warning. The third will happen once.

For the first visitation we ought to be deeply thankful, and remember it with great love. For the second we must be diligent, so that he is pleased to dwell with us, and so that he may visit us with special grace on the day of his birth; we ought to conduct ourselves devoutly. For the third we must watch very earnestly, because he commands us very earnestly to watch—that is, to guard ourselves from sin and to grow in God’s grace.

And because of these three visitations the holy church has established that from this day on we should prepare ourselves in virtue more diligently than before, remembering that he came in the flesh for our salvation, that he will especially visit us with his grace on the day of his birth, and that the third time he will come on the Day of Judgment and give us eternal kingdom.

**B.** And for this visitation there is also a threefold preparation.

First, those who are faithful, waiting for their Lord, must live honorably, and especially as his coming draws near. This is what the word of Isaiah points to in chapter 1, verses 16–17: “Stop doing evil; learn to do good.” And as David says in Psalm 34:15 and 37:27: “Turn away from evil and do good.”

Second, when we hear that such a great Lord is near, we should get ready in three ways. First, by preparing a house for him—that is, by cleansing our souls from sins. For through Isaiah, in chapter 1, verse 16, he says: “Wash yourselves and be clean. Put away the evil of your thoughts from before my eyes.”

Second, we are to prepare ourselves with beautiful clothing. Isaiah says in chapter 52, verse 1: “Put on your garment of glory, Jerusalem, holy city!” In this place Jerusalem means the assembly of the faithful, which is a holy city where King Christ is to dwell forever. And that city is to put on a garment of glory—that is, virtues that make a person honored and glorious. That garment is better for any soul, beyond all measure, than all the garments of this world with which the body is clothed. In fact, a single virtue clothes a person better than any bodily garment. And that garment must be white—that is, not stained by sin.

**C.** Third, we must prepare ourselves to set worthy food before so great a Lord. The worthy food with which Christ is fed is the doing of his will. He himself says in John 4:34: “My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to finish his work.” And again he says in John 6:27: “Prepare food, not the food that perishes, but the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you.”

Those people prepare for themselves food that does not perish, who fulfill the will of God and remain in it. For they will forever enjoy the joy of God. In this way true Christians feed Christ every day when they keep his commandments. And he himself will testify to this on the Day of Judgment, when he says to the righteous, in Matthew 25:35: “I was hungry, and you gave me food; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink.”

So we ought to prepare ourselves in this way: to remember his first holy visitation worthily, and to get ready for the second and the third, and so to receive his holy body worthily on the feast of his birth. For Saint Augustine says in a sermon: “Dearest brothers! By God’s grace the days have come to us again in which we desire to celebrate the birth of God. Therefore I ask you and urge you: let us work, as best we can, so that on that day we may be able to come to the altar of God with a clean conscience, with great earnestness, and with a pure heart and body—and so be found worthy to receive his body and his blood, not for judgment, but for the healing of the soul and for salvation. For our life depends on the body of Christ, as he himself says in John 6:53: ‘Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in yourselves.’ Therefore, whoever wants to receive life, let him change his life. If he does not change his life, he will receive that life to judgment, and he will be more harmed by it than made alive.

“Oh, how blessed is that soul which, with God’s help, has so ordered its life that it is worthy to receive Christ as a guest! And again, how miserable and sorrowful is that conscience which has so stained itself with evil deeds that Christ is not willing to dwell in it, but the devil begins to rule there!” All this is what Saint Augustine says.

From all of this, as Saint Paul also commands us in today’s Epistle, let us take instruction. In Romans 13:12 he says: “Let us throw off the works of darkness”—that is, let us put away sins that lead to eternal darkness—“and let us put on the armor of light”—that is, let us receive virtues that lead us to eternal light. Living in this way, we will rightly remember the threefold visitation of Christ. We will be worthy that he visit us now with special grace, then at our death, and finally on the Day of Judgment.

He has already visited us by becoming flesh; let us remember that this visitation has already happened. He has visited us by his grace in baptism, freeing us from our sins. And although we have sinned after baptism, yet he visited us with grace in repentance. And if there are some who have not sinned mortally after baptism, still he has visited them and continues to visit them with special grace.

And we are waiting for the third visitation, on the Day of Judgment. While we wait, we must always be ready. For he himself says, Luke 12:40 and Matthew 25:13: “Be ready, for at the hour you do not expect, the Son of Man is coming.” And we must be ready in such a way that we willingly endure, for the sake of our dear Christ, whatever meets us—just as he, for us sinners, though he owed us nothing, willingly endured a cruel death for his enemies. For this death he came of his own choice to Jerusalem and rode in on a young donkey, weeping greatly, showing the people of Jerusalem a gracious visitation.

And so this Gospel is read today about that spiritual visitation by which he visited the faithful through his holy suffering—not to seize their property, not to kill them, but to redeem them from death and give them eternal kingdom. That is why the prophet Zechariah prophesies to the holy church in chapter 9, verse 9, and says: “Look, your king comes to you, righteous and a savior; he is poor and riding on a donkey, on a colt.”

In this word the prophet comforts the holy church, saying: “Look, your king”—a king gracious to avenge, mighty to defend, wise to rule, rich to reward. He says “your” because he created you; your, because he sustains you; your, because he protects you from the devil; your, because he bought you with his death; your, because he loved you to the point of death; your, because he will give you eternal kingdom, if in the end you remain thankful.

So he says: “Look, your king has come to you”—or, “has ridden to you”—“righteous,” who will give each according to his deeds; “a savior,” for he has come to save. As he himself says in John 3:16–17: “God loved the world in such a way that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him should not be lost, but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through him.”

Now you have his own testimony that he was sent by the Father into this world not to judge the world, but to save the world—that is, the people chosen out of the world for salvation. For he will not judge them to eternal condemnation. Therefore the prophet says to the holy church: “Look, your king is coming to you, righteous and a savior—and he is poor,” so that by his poverty he might make you rich. As Saint Paul says in 2 Corinthians 8:9: “Christ was made poor for us, so that by his poverty we might become rich”—that is, now rich in virtues, and afterwards in the joy of heaven. For that reason he came poor, “riding on a donkey,” as today’s reading bears witness.

But I do not want to explain that part now, because it seems better to me to keep it for Palm Sunday, since it took place at that time—and also so that I do not keep you too long today.

Therefore, dearest ones, let this be enough for you now. Prepare yourselves for his second and his final visitation. Grieve over your sins. Grow in virtue. Do works of repentance. And with your whole heart desire his visitation.
