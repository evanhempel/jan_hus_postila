title: Ninth Sunday After Christmas
---

This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon on the Ninth Sunday After Christmas, based on Luke chapter 8, verses 4-15, where Jesus explains the parable of the sower. The sermon focuses on the different ways people receive God's word and the consequences of their responses.

- Jan Hus begins by noting how crowds gathered to hear Jesus, who taught in parables to conceal truth from those not ready to receive it.
- The parable of the sower illustrates four types of soil representing different responses to God's word:
  1. **Path** - The word is snatched away by the devil before it can take root.
  2. **Rocky ground** - The word is received with joy but withers without deep roots in times of trial.
  3. **Thorny ground** - The word is choked by life's worries, riches, and pleasures.
  4. **Good soil** - The word is received in a noble heart, producing lasting fruit.
- Jan Hus emphasizes that many are distracted by worldly concerns, leading them to reject or neglect God's word.
- He warns against pride, greed, and lust, which prevent the word from bearing fruit in one's life.
- The sermon concludes with a reminder that those who hear and obey God's word are blessed and become part of God's family.

> **Key Quote**: "But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop." (Luke 8:15)
