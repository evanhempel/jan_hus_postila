# Fourth Sunday of Lent

Fourth Sunday in Lent  
St. John, chapter 6, verses 1–14  

At that time, when Herod had put John to death, Jesus left Jerusalem and went across the Sea of Galilee — that region called Galilee, and that same sea is also called the Sea of Tiberias, after the city of Tiberias. A great crowd was following him, because they had seen the miracles he did for those who were sick.  

Jesus went up on a mountain and sat down there with his disciples. And the feast of the Lamb — the great feast day of the Jews — was drawing very near.  

When Jesus lifted up his eyes and saw that a very great crowd was coming toward him, he said to Philip, “Where shall we buy bread so that these people may eat?” He said this to test him, because he himself already knew what he was going to do.  

Philip answered him, “Two hundred days’ wages worth of bread would not be enough for each of them to have even a little.”  

One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to him, “There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish. But what is that for so many?”  

Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” There was plenty of grass in that place, so the men sat down — about five thousand of them.  

Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks — that is, when he had given praise to God — he distributed to those who were seated, and likewise also of the fish, as much as they wanted.  

When they were filled, he said to his disciples, “Gather up the pieces that are left over, so that nothing is lost.” So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with the pieces — the *fragmenta*, the broken bits that were left — from the five barley loaves and the two fish, left by those who had eaten.  

When the people saw the miracle that he had done, they said, “This is truly the prophet who is to come into the world.”

**A.** The meaning of this holy Gospel is clear enough on the surface, yet our Savior can give many more insights in it to his faithful ones, by which their souls may find comfort. And because this holy reading tells of Christ feeding the people — and because, though this event did not happen on this very date, it points to the spiritual feeding by which Christ satisfies his faithful — it is appointed for today, for the comfort of true and devout penitents, according to God’s wisdom.  

From the beginning of Lent, the Epistles and Gospels have been urging us to repentance. And because now those who repent should begin to taste some comfort in their spirits, today the Mass begins more joyfully — in the words and even in the music and singing. The priest says: “Rejoice, Jerusalem!” That is, “Rejoice, you soul who waits for the joy of the heavenly Jerusalem.”  

Or again: “Rejoice, Jerusalem!” — that is, “Rejoice, Christian congregation! You who have already turned from your sins are to be fed and satisfied with bread from Christ — that is, with his holy body.”  

About this feeding, the Mass says in figurative words: “Rejoice, Jerusalem, and all you who love her, come together! Rejoice with great joy, all you who were in sorrow, so that you may rejoice and be satisfied from the breasts of her consolation.”  

The meaning is this: the holy Church — the assembly of God’s faithful children, which is pictured for us under the name Jerusalem — is called to rejoice.  

Second, all are called to gather together and share fellowship in love — all who love the holy Church — so that they too may rejoice in spirit, who had been troubled on account of their sins, because they will be fed from the breasts of the Church’s comfort.  

One breast is God’s grace here in this life, by which, through the holy Church, he feeds his younger children. The other breast is the joy of heaven, with which he feeds his older children now, and with which he will someday feed all his children together.  

**B.** Therefore, faithful, repentant children of God should today rejoice in spirit and gather together in one place in love, in devotion, and by receiving the body of the Lord. That is why at Mass we sing so gladly: “Come together, all you who love her” — that is, who love the holy Church — “and rejoice with great joy, all you who were in sorrow, so that now you may rejoice and be satisfied: now by grace, and later in glory.”  

To be found worthy of that satisfaction, let us thoughtfully consider Christ’s feeding in the Gospel. The holy reading says: “Jesus went across the Sea of Galilee,” that is, that region of Galilee, “which is the Sea of Tiberias,” meaning by the city of Tiberias, which had been built on that sea by Herod in honor of the emperor named Tiberius.  

Jesus crossed that sea when he heard that John the Baptist had been executed, so that he would not give an occasion for Herod’s evil to be stirred up further. That is why Jesus withdrew — and also to give an example to his followers who would come after him, that sometimes it is good and wise to step aside.  

“And a great crowd followed him,” it says, and then a little later: “and the feast day of the Lamb was very near.” In the Latin text stands the word *Pascha*. That word is not purely Latin, nor Greek, nor Hebrew, but it is taken in some way from the Hebrew tongue. In our language, *Pascha* means “passing over” or “crossing.”  

God commanded the Jews, when he led them out of the land of Egypt, out from under the violence of the pagans and across the sea, that they should eat a lamb and keep a solemn feast. This feast of the lamb is what is mentioned here.  

I do not think it is well translated here as “Easter feast,” because at that time the Christian Easter feast did not yet exist. And if we understand our Easter — “the Great Night” — to be the night in which the great Christ did a great work by rising from the dead, then we must see that *Pascha* in this passage does not mean Easter night, but the feast of the lamb, as I have said. Of this the reading says, “The great feast day of the Lamb was very near.”  

“When Jesus lifted up his eyes and saw that a great crowd was coming toward him…”  

A great crowd came, as was said earlier, for four reasons: to be healed of their diseases, to be fed, to see miracles, and to hear his words. And there was a fifth, very empty motive: to catch him in his words and accuse him.  

Without doubt, every one of Christ’s actions in this holy reading should be very meaningful to us, for our instruction. His going up on the mountain means withdrawing from the world and rising to a higher way of life. His teaching on the mountain means that his doctrine is exalted above worldly wisdom. His wonderful feeding of so many people means a spiritual feeding, about which John writes earlier (4:31–34). His receiving the crowds to himself shows his great mercy; his feeding them shows his great power. His question to the disciples is for their gracious instruction, and for us an example: that we also should ask counsel of others when we are about to undertake some great work.  

On this same passage, Saint Augustine says something like this:  

“As the feast of the Lamb of the Jews was drawing near, the Lord raised up this crowd that followed him, both by word and by deed, for their salvation. As another evangelist writes (Luke 9:11), he spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and he healed those who had need of healing. When he had finished teaching and healing, he fed them abundantly from a very small amount of food.”  

Therefore, dearest brothers, since the feast of our redemption is also drawing near, let us, with the help of our fellow believers, follow the Lord with wholehearted devotion. Let us carefully notice which path of deeds he walked, so that we may be worthy to follow in his footsteps.  

So far Augustine — teaching us to prepare for the coming feasts by following our beloved Savior, so that he may be pleased to feed us with his body, teach us by his word, and at last receive us into his grace.  

He has already crossed the sea of this miserable world and is seated on the mountain with his disciples in the kingdom of heaven. Let us press after him, as the crowds pressed after him. These crowds, says Saint Remigius, picture the holy Christian Church which follows its Lord — not with bodily feet, but with holy deeds. As he himself says (John 12:26): “Whoever serves me, let him follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also.”  

And so that we do not perish along the way, since the journey is long, we must eat some loaves and fish.  

**C.** What then do the loaves and fish by which Christ fed the crowds stand for?  

The first loaf is fear of eternal damnation. We must often eat of that loaf. Truly, I myself often eat of it; let each examine himself. Our Savior himself often set this before us in his teaching: outer darkness, weeping and grinding of teeth, hands and feet bound, the eternal fire and hell. He says in Luke 16:22, “The rich man died and was buried in hell.”  

The second loaf is remembrance of death. That is very useful to warn us away from sin. Scripture says (Ecclesiasticus 7:40): “Remember your last things, and you will never sin.” Remember that people have given their goods to others, their bodies to worms, and their souls to the devil — if they were not good. Remember how hard it will be to die, because a person does not know where he is going.  

The third loaf is abandoning sin. God commands us to eat that loaf when he says through the prophet (Isaiah 55:7): “Let the wicked forsake his evil way.”  

The fourth loaf is great pain and sorrow for sin. Scripture says through Jeremiah (6:26): “Daughter of my people, put on sackcloth and roll in ashes; mourn as for an only son; make for yourself bitter weeping.”  

The daughter of God’s people is the soul that has sinned. She must put on sackcloth — that is, take on some bodily discipline. She must cover herself with ashes — that is, humbly remember that she is dust and will return to dust. She must make for herself lamentation for an only son — for Christ, who died for her, and whom she has lost by sin. Surely there ought to be a greater sorrow for losing the Son of God than if she had lost her only child whom she loved dearly. And she must make for herself bitter weeping.  

Whatever is very bitter cuts to the heart when a person tastes it. So must our weeping over sin be: not the false drooling that some women do, wanting to come to the sacrament, and afterward they do not abandon fornication and other sins.  

Therefore the fifth loaf is the resolve not to sin anymore. This loaf Bishop Jesus gave as penance to the adulterous woman whom they had caught in adultery and brought before him so that he would condemn her. After those priests and elders had slipped away — unworthy to judge her because of their own sins — he said to her (John 8:10–11): “Woman, has no one condemned you — that is, to death?”  

She answered, “No one, Lord.”  

And he said to her, “Neither do I condemn you; go, and do not sin anymore.”  

That is the repentance without which sin cannot be forgiven. That is the loaf which the despairing do not eat, nor those who return to their sins again.  

These loaves are barley loaves. Barley bread is coarse and not pleasant to eat; it is hard to chew. Therefore the pleasure‑loving do not like that bread. A man who loves luxury, if he had other bread, would not quickly eat five barley loaves.  

In the same way, these loaves are distasteful to those who live in sin: they are bitter, rough, sharp, and do not want to go down their throat, because they refuse to chew on them.  

Oh, how sharp is the remembrance of eternal damnation! And yet how slowly it enters the desire of a person to abandon his sin.  

But these loaves feed a repentant person very well. The Gospel hints at this when it says that those who ate from the five loaves were filled.  

**D.** And what of the two fish that went with those barley loaves? They are devout prayer and holy fasting. With these fish, together with the five loaves, the Lord Jesus feeds the whole company of penitents, pictured by the five thousand men.  

But from whom shall we receive these loaves and fish? Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, shows us when he says, “There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish.” What is that boy?  

Scripture shows us in Matthew 12:18, where God the Father says of Christ: “Behold my child whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul delights.”  

We know, then, that this child is the Son of God, Jesus, who carries these five loaves. No one can be satisfied by them unless he gives them, and unless, according to his command, the penitents sit down on the ground — that is, humble themselves, confessing that they are unworthy because of their sins — and sit down on the grass, remembering their frailty: that today they are alive, and tomorrow they will wither like grass.  

Then the twelve baskets filled with the pieces or *fragmenta* from those loaves and fish are the twelve apostles, who gathered those pieces more fully than others, because they lived above other people in holiness. They ate of those loaves and fish in ways that many other penitents have not yet reached.  

This, briefly, about repentance.  

**E.** But another question can be asked: How is it that because of fear of his enemies Jesus did not go up to the feast of the lamb in Jerusalem, while John the Baptist rebuked King Herod boldly and without fear, even unto death?  

We may give three reasons.  

First, knowing the will of God — that he was to go to death according to God’s plan for the salvation of humanity — Christ was aligning his human will with the will of his Father.  

Second, he was showing his power in withdrawing from death against the will of his enemies, so that they would know that it was in his power to decide when and how he would die.  

Third, he was giving an example to those who would come after him, showing them when they should prudently withdraw from their enemies.  

Do not imagine that Christ was less bold than Saint John the Baptist, or that he was less worthy in any virtue — although Christ lived among people, ate meat, and drank wine, and John did not.  

Yet Christ surpassed John, fasting forty days and forty nights in the wilderness, which John did not. Likewise in other virtues he surpassed John, including orderly boldness: he rebuked the priests even when they were taking up stones against him — and that more than once. And when others ran away, he remained, and even stepped forward and rebuked them, saying that they were acting by the power of darkness. In Luke 22:53 he says, “This is your hour, and the power of darkness” — that is, power from the devil laid in your hearts, so that by evil desire you hand me over to death.  

**F.** Another question remains: How is Christ excused, according to the Law, for not being at the feast of the lamb because of fear?  

The answer is: those who had deadly enmity pursuing them were excused before God from being present.  

And in the same way, I trust in God that I am excused for not having gone to Rome, when I was summoned, to appear before the Pope.  

First, because for three years I had appointed my legal representatives, and they were never granted a hearing; instead they were arrested and imprisoned for seeking the truth.  

Second, because it is a much longer journey from Prague to Rome than from the far side of the Sea of Tiberias to Jerusalem, to which Christ had come and from which he withdrew.  

Third, because in God’s law there is no command that people should be dragged so far to Rome for nothing.  

Fourth, because there is very little of God’s truth practiced at the papal court, according to God’s law.  

Fifth, because I would have neglected the people here in the preaching of God’s word; and what good could I do on the road? And if I reached the court, what holiness would I find there? Nothing but quarrels — unless I were willing to buy and sell spiritual things.  

Sixth, because I would waste much alms money for nothing, money that I would have to collect from the people.  

Seventh, because the dispute I am engaged in is against the customs of the Pope and against his power — not a power borrowed from God, but invented by the devil.  

For Pope Alexander the Fifth issued a bull, for money, in which he forbade that God’s word be preached to the people in chapels anywhere — even if those chapels had been founded for that very purpose and confirmed by popes.  

In that bull it also said that no preaching was to be done anywhere except in parish churches and monasteries. Our late Archbishop of Prague, priest Zbyněk, together with other prelates, obtained this bull. And a monk, Jaroslav, a false bishop, rode as messenger to obtain it. In that bull it was also written that in the kingdom of Bohemia — especially in Prague — and in the Margraviate of Moravia, the hearts of many people were so greatly corrupted with heresy that they needed to be carefully watched and punished.  

So that bull shows that both pope and priest Zbyněk acted against the law of God: the pope by issuing it, and Zbyněk by obtaining it — so that God’s word would not be preached freely. This is against Scripture and against the deeds of our Savior Jesus Christ, who commanded his disciples (Mark 16:15) to “go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature.” And they did preach everywhere, as Mark says (Mark 16:20) — everywhere, that is, wherever people were fit to hear.  

Our Savior, in today’s Gospel, preached in the wilderness; at other times he preached from a boat, standing on the sea; and in the streets; and in towns without churches; and in villages. He even told his disciples to preach on the housetops. And he sent his servants to call people to the eternal supper along the hedges and at the crossroads.  

How then can that bull be made to agree with Scripture and with the deeds of Christ? Not at all.  

Therefore I first appealed from that bull to the pope. And because the same issue touches this present pope too, truth has no place there. So the second part of that bull may be right in this sense only: that many hearts in Prague have truly been corrupted with heresy — namely in those who obtained such bulls against Scripture and against the salvation of people, and who agreed with them.  

What good were they seeking when they demanded that God’s word not be preached in chapels or anywhere except in parishes and monasteries? In that there is envy, greed, and malice against God’s word, and a plan to shut the Bethlehem Chapel off from preaching.  

Other archbishops once built chapels precisely so that preaching could be done in them. Archbishop Jan of Prague himself laid the foundation of Bethlehem Chapel with his own hand and confirmed it. And then priest Zbyněk, now dead, having been pushed and urged by the canons and parish priests of Prague and by monks — who had made deals with parish priests about Bethlehem — wanted to destroy that chapel’s preaching, and so to forbid me from preaching altogether.  

For they had decided this: if, according to the pope’s order, I no longer preached in chapels, and if I had no other place except parishes and monasteries as the pope said, then the priests and monks would agree among themselves not to let me preach in their churches.  

So, recognizing this, and seeing their unworthy command and their sly malice, I took my stand with the help of the merciful Savior. And in the end I did not go to the papal court, that I might not throw away my life for nothing. For everywhere there are many enemies — both Czechs and Germans — who seek my death.  

The pope would be my judge and my enemy; the cardinals also my enemies, as I have found in their letters, where they write of me as a heretic without ever hearing me or seeing me. For when preaching goes against pride, against greed, and especially against simony, it touches popes and cardinals. Therefore the truth would befall me there as it befell Jesus.  

I have also discovered false witnesses and their testimony that they gave against me in Prague and then sent to Rome. Among those witnesses, one swore that I had preached that when a priest says Mass there is no body of Christ present. Another swore that I preached that when a priest in mortal sin says Mass, he blesses bread, but it does not become the body of Christ. A third swore that I had preached that an old woman is in every way more worthy than the pope. And many other lies they pinned on me.  

In a letter that a cardinal — my chief judge — issued against me, he already labels me a deceiver of the people and an inventor of errors. In the complaint written by priest Zbyněk, a priest named Michael, pastor of St. Adalbert in the New Town, writes that all faithful Christians in the kingdom of Bohemia consider me a heretic, that every day in Bethlehem I preach errors and heresies, and that I am the prince of heretics and the head of heretics.  

But I trust that this will not harm me before my dear Christ, nor does it disturb me. I know that they did the same to the priests of his holy grace, and finally killed them with a shameful and cruel death. To his holy grace I have entrusted my cause, that he may bring it to completion as he pleases — even if that means my disgrace and death at the hands of people — and that he may never allow me to fall away from his truth.  

They also say, “Let him be worthy of death and go to Rome, as Christ went to Jerusalem.” I answer: If I knew it were God’s will that I should die in Rome, then I would go. And if I knew that I would do some real good there, as Christ did for the people who came after him and for those who lived in his time, I would go — though he did not bring salvation to the bishops, scholars, priests, and lawyers who, out of envy and because he rebuked their sins and revealed them to the people as deceivers and heretics, murdered him in a cruel and shameful way.  

**G.** Let bishops and priests be sent after me by the highest Bishop, as they were sent after Jesus.  

The Germans already began, when armed men with crossbows, spears, and swords came to Bethlehem Chapel while I was preaching. Bernard Chotek was the leader of that plot. But God confused their way so that they did not know what to do, as many people can testify; they came at the wrong time.  

Bishops were also sent after the Lord Jesus while he preached. But because his hour had not yet come, the servants of the bishops preferred to listen to him rather than arrest him. In the same way, my hour of death has not yet come; so they have left me until God’s time.  

Later the Germans, having taken counsel, wanted to tear Bethlehem Chapel down. They met together in council — in German they call it the *Rathaus* — and one Czech, called Holubář, spoke among the Czechs, asking whether they would agree, as the Germans had agreed, that Bethlehem should be torn down.  

Then the faithful Czechs, seeing that this was against God and against his word, and against the salvation of people, and that it would be a disgrace to the Czechs, and also knowing that they did not have lawful power to tear down such a useful house of God in such a city, refused to consent.  

Look at this German boldness: they would not dare to tear down a neighbor’s oven or stable without the king’s permission, and yet they dared to attempt this against a house of God! But God did not give them power to do it, so that they might repent more easily, and so that later they would not dare so lightly to lay hands on destroying his sanctuary.  

I have written all this for those who come after us, as a warning:  

– For the good, that they may stand boldly for the truth.  
– For those blind in regard to the truth, that they may beware of such things.  
– For those who do not know my case and yet slander me, that by learning the truth they may not sin by their slanders.
