This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon on Matthew 22:1-14, the parable of the wedding feast. Jan Hus explains the spiritual meaning behind the earthly wedding imagery, warning listeners to prepare for God's eternal feast through faith and love.

- **Key Points**:
  1. **The Parable's Meaning**:
     - The wedding represents Christ's union with the Church.
     - The king is God the Father, the son is Christ, and the guests are humanity.
  2. **Rejected Invitation**:
     - The first invitees (Jews) refused through disbelief, worldly distractions, or even persecuting God's messengers (prophets and apostles).
  3. **New Guests Called**:
     - After Jerusalem's destruction (symbolizing judgment), the invitation extends to Gentiles ("go to the highways").
  4. **The Wedding Garment**:
     - Represents love and good works. Without it (like the unprepared guest), one faces eternal darkness.
  5. **Final Warning**:
     - "Many are called, but few are chosen" (Matthew 22:14). Salvation requires perseverance in faith and love.

> **Key Quote**:  
> *"Therefore, let each of us humble ourselves, for we do not know if we are chosen; many begin well but do not endure to the end. May God grant that we be worthy of this wedding!"*  
> —Jan Hus
