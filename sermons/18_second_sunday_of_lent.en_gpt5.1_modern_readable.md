# Second Sunday of Lent

From Matthew 15:21–28

“At that time Jesus went out and left Gennesaret, away from the teachers and from the scribes, and went into the region of Tyre and Sidon. And, see, a Canaanite woman (a pagan woman from those Gentile nations that were called Canaanites) came out from that region and cried out to him, saying: ‘Have mercy on me [be gracious to me], Lord [that is, God], Son of David [that is, man]! My daughter is badly tormented by a demon.’ But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying: ‘Send her away, because she keeps crying out after us.’ And he answered and said: ‘I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel’ (that is, to the Jewish people who came from Israel, that is, from Jacob). And she came (Mark 7:25 says, ‘she fell down’) and worshiped him [as God], saying: ‘Lord, help me!’ He answered and said: ‘It is not good to take the children’s bread [that is, the bread of the sons, meaning the Jews] and throw it to the dogs [that is, the Gentiles].’ She said: ‘Yes, Lord, it is so; yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.’ Then Jesus answered and said to her: ‘O woman, great is your faith. Let it be done for you as you desire.’ And her daughter was healed from that very hour [the hour in which Christ said, ‘Let it be done for you’].”

This holy reading, taken just as the words sound, has a fairly clear meaning.

Tyre and Sidon were two cities on the border of the Promised Land. But because the Jews could not drive all the Gentiles out of the land, Gentiles still lived in those cities and in that region at the time of Jesus.

So this woman, coming out from that region, first went into the house to speak with Jesus, as Saint Mark writes in chapter 7, verses 24–25. But because he did not hear her there, she ran after him on the road, continually begging him to have mercy on her and to heal her daughter, whom the devil was tormenting very severely.

Yet the merciful Christ did not listen to her at once, nor to his disciples who interceded for her, until the right time. And he gave the reason, saying that he was not sent by God to heal the sick except those from the house of Israel—that is, only Jews.

And although Christ truthfully called the Gentile people “dogs,” she, catching hold of Christ’s words, added that the dogs are allowed to eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ tables. And because her mouth was faithful, her heart humble, and her faith great, she received Christ’s praise for her faith and was heard in what she had asked.

Therefore Saint Bede says: “In the holy reading that has just now been read, dearest brothers, we have heard that the great faith of the woman, her patience, perseverance, and humility are praised. More wonderful still is her devotion, that she, though a Gentile, having never heard the holy Scriptures, possessed those very virtues that the holy Scripture commends.” So far Bede.

From his words, and from the example of this Gentile woman, we are taught that, holding this precious pagan woman before us as a model, we should imitate her in faith, in patience, in perseverance, and in humility, so that we too may be heard and praised by the merciful Savior.

About him it is written: “Jesus went out” — that is, he went out from the land of Gennesaret, leaving the teachers and scribes because they were complaining and taking offense that his disciples were breaking the traditions of the elders by eating with unwashed hands. “So he withdrew”; and, as the commentary says, “he went out in order, by the faith of a Gentile woman, to rebuke the unbelief of the teachers.” So, “Jesus went out and went into the region of Tyre and Sidon.”

“And behold, a Canaanite woman,” that is, from the race of the Gentiles called Canaanites, “cried out,” that is, she shouted: “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David!”

Her words are short, but full of wisdom. Therefore Saint John Chrysostom says: “Listen and see the wisdom of the woman; notice what her spirit is saying. ‘Have mercy on me,’ for thus the Canaanite pagan woman said within herself: I know nothing good about myself; I flee to mercy, where there is unspeakable healing.”

Second, see for whom she asks mercy: “for me,” saying, “Have mercy on *me*.” So the golden mouth speaks this way: “What do you need, woman?” And she answers: “I seek mercy.” “For whom do you seek it?” She answers again: “For me.” “What do you need it for?” She says: “Because the devil torments my daughter.”

“Why then do you not say: ‘Have mercy on me and on my daughter’?” And he answers for her: “The cruel sting, the worst natural pain, has driven mercy out of order.”

Again Saint John Chrysostom says: “See the woman’s wisdom! She does not say, ‘Have mercy on *my daughter*,’ but, ‘Have mercy on *me*!’ For she does not feel someone else’s pain; I feel it all; I alone, poor woman, bear the pain; I, unhappy one, see my own torment every day. Where shall I go? Where shall I turn? ‘Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David, for my daughter is terribly tormented by a demon.’”

O glorious confession! This Gentile woman confesses both the divinity and the humanity of Christ: his divinity against the power of demons, when she calls him “Lord”; and his humanity, that he might be pleased to have mercy, because he, being God, chose to become man so that, in mercy, he might free us from the devil. Therefore she says, “Son of David.”

She clearly names her trouble: “My daughter is badly tormented by a demon.” The pain is that she is her “daughter”; it is great, because she is “badly tormented”; it is dreadful, because a “demon” is tormenting her.

“But he did not answer her a word.” Chrysostom comments: “He did not ask about the reasons for her crying out; he did not comfort her while she was calling; he did not quiet her cries.” Here I finally notice something amazing: Did you see the woman’s diligence? Did you see her courage? Did you see her perseverance? Did you see her faith? And yet Jesus “did not answer her a word”! A strange thing, O strange contrast in the story! The woman begs, she prays, she laments; with her cries she fills heaven; she falls at his feet; she multiplies her pleas; she lays out her pain—and the Lover of mankind does not answer. The Word is silent, the fountain is shut, the physician withholds the medicine.”

So far Chrysostom.

And why did he not hear her at once?

First, because this delay and seeming refusal from Christ gave her more virtue and deeper piety.

Second, for our example: so that when you pray and are not answered at once, you will not give up praying.

“Then his disciples came and begged him, saying, ‘Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.’”

Did they plead for her out of compassion? Or did they want to be free from her constant shouting? Or were they ashamed of the crowd gathering around them because of her? For earlier, as Saint Mark says in 7:25, she had run ahead and then back again—as the reading says here—and kept crying out.

The disciples say, “Send her away,” that is, show her mercy, set her free, “because she is crying out after us.”

“But he answered and said, ‘I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.’” That is, “I was sent by the Father especially to the Jews who have gone astray,” as Isaiah says in chapter 53, verse 6: “We all like sheep have gone astray.”

And so he did not want to give the Jews a reason to take offense at him, if they should see him dealing too freely and favorably with a Canaanite woman and hearing her request.

“And she came nearer,” now already encouraged that he had spoken at all, “and worshiped him,” says Saint Mark (7:25), falling at his feet, and said, “Lord, help me!”

What a short word from a worn-out woman! Poor soul—she had tired herself by running and crying; she carried a heavy pain for her daughter; and because she still did not see any sign of mercy, she collapsed at his feet. After catching her breath a little, she said only this: “Lord, help me! I can no longer run and cry, but I will not let go of your mercy: Lord, help me!”

Notice the three petitions.

Her first was: “Have mercy on me!”

The disciples’ prayer was: “Send her away!”

Her third is now: “Lord, help me!”

“Merciful One, have mercy”—that is the first.  
“O Deliverer, do not hold her, but send her away free from the devil to her home”—that is the second.  
“O almighty Lord, help her against the great power of the devil”—that is the third.

From this you may learn: mercy removes sin; “sending away” removes guilt, or punishment, or vengeance for sin; and “help” supports us in temptation. And thus these three requests—“Have mercy, send away, and help”—freed the Gentile woman from sin and from torment and brought her into great grace and into the praise of Christ.

Then the reading says that he “answered, ‘It is not good to take the children’s bread’—that is, the bread meant for the sons, for the Jews—‘and throw it to the dogs.’”

That means: It is not good to take the word of salvation, which must first be given to the Jews, and give it to the dogs—that is, to the Gentiles, who, like dogs, are always barking against God and, around their idols, walk in blood like dogs around carcasses.

O hard answer! O sharp sword of words! O heavy wound given by the Lord to the poor little woman!

First, she came to him into the house, and he went out ahead of her. She ran after him, and he fled before her. She cried after him, and he was silent. The disciples pleaded for her, and he answered them instead. And now, when she is faint and lying at his feet, saying, “Lord, help me,” how does he comfort her? By counting her among the dogs, saying, “It is not good to take the children’s bread and give it to the dogs.”

O goodness of the physician, where are you now? You touch one so cruelly wounded! You press on her wounds! You call the poor little woman a dog and yet do not lead her into despair?

The gentle Christ might answer: “It is not as you say. I am not driving her away; I am drawing her out so that she will cry out. I am pulling her after me so that she will not give up. I am holding her up so that, though insulted, she will not fall. I will give her refreshment so that she does not faint. I will teach her to say:

‘Yes, Lord! Yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.’”

Listen to what she says: “Yes, Lord”—that is, “It is true, just as you say. I am a dog, and they are the children, as you call them. Do not take away the bread that rightly belongs to them in order to give it to me. But, as to a little dog, give me the crumbs. Give health to my daughter; let that one kindness be done for her. You have already done many great kindnesses among the Jews. They count your blessings as crumbs under the table. I, your little dog, will be satisfied with that. Be gracious to me!”

“And Jesus answered her, ‘O woman, great is your faith; let it be done for you as you desire.’”

This word shows Christ’s great mercy and his wonder at her faith, just as he once marveled at the faith of the centurion. “O woman, great is your faith”—great in confession, great in steadfastness, great in the deep desire of your heart.

Now he has opened his mercy to her; now he praises her faith; now he rewards her perseverance, saying, “Let it be done for you as you desire.”

Then the golden-mouthed preacher says: “You are healed; now be the physician. I entrust the medicine to you. Let your will apply it—heal your daughter!” A marvelous thing! We do not read of any other person to whom Christ gave such freedom to will and to receive, as he did to her. And would he have given it, if there had not been a reason as great as her faith?

“And her daughter was healed from that very hour”—from the hour when Christ said, “Let it be done for you as you desire.” For Saint Mark says in 7:30: “When the woman returned home, she found the girl sitting on the bed, free from the demon”—for it had already gone out of her.

Morally, we are taught that we must diligently pray to the Lord God that he would help us against the devil. We are also taught that God does not accept a person because of outward status, but that in every nation whoever practices righteousness is precious to him, as Saint Peter says in Acts 10:34–35.

For this reason the merciful Savior, when he dealt with Gentiles, did many miracles and spoke graciously to them, as to this Gentile woman and to the centurion. And we do not read that he ever, in such clear words, praised anyone’s faith as highly as he praised the faith of this pagan woman and of the centurion.

We learn further that this Gentile woman, because of her faith, was given understanding. She understood that the Gentiles were like dogs, because they were devoted to dead idols as dogs are to carcasses. She also understood that Christ called the spiritual food given to the Jews “bread”—that is, his teaching and his miracles. And she understood as well that when the Gentiles turn to his mercy, they too will be counted worthy to be fed by him.

Amen.
