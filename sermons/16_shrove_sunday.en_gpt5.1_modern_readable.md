# Shrove Sunday

Saint Luke, chapter 18, verses 31–43.

“At that time Jesus took the twelve disciples aside privately and said to them: ‘Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that has been written through the prophets about the Son of Man [the son of the Virgin Mary] will be fulfilled. For he will be handed over to the Gentiles by the rulers; he will be mocked, flogged, and spat upon. And after they have flogged him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise from the dead.’ But they understood none of these things; this word was hidden from them, and they did not understand what he had said to them. And it happened that, as he drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. When he heard a crowd passing by, he asked what this might be. And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. Then he began to cry out, ‘Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!’ Those who went ahead of Jesus scolded him and told him to be quiet, but he cried out all the more, ‘Son of David, have mercy on me!’ Jesus stopped and commanded that the man be brought to him. When he had come near, Jesus asked him, ‘What do you want me to do for you?’ He said, ‘Lord, let me see.’ Jesus said to him, ‘See again; your faith has healed you.’ Immediately he could see, and he followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.”

Holy Church, the gathering of faithful Christians, has set this reading before her children today as a memorial, so that, remembering the dreadful suffering of their gracious Father, and his innocent, shameful, and cruel death, they would pull back from vanity, knowing that he gave himself to that suffering and to that death for them. Ah, misery for the foolish people of Carnival, who forget such a great kindness and then throw themselves into vanities with which they mock their Father! To keep us from the sins that rule people most strongly at this time, let us take this holy reading deeply to heart.

Look at what the Savior says to his disciples when he takes them aside privately: that he is going willingly to be mocked, spat upon, flogged, and killed; but the people of Carnival go willingly into sexual sin, gluttony, foolishness, and the destruction of their own souls! Why? Because they do not understand this holy reading. Understand this: they may hear it and grasp it with the body, but they do not gladly receive it in the soul.

Even the apostles, still worldly and fleshly, did not understand his words, though they are very clear, so that anyone could understand them. Saint Luke says: “Jesus took the twelve disciples and said to them.” “He took them aside privately,” as Saint Matthew says in chapter 20, verse 17, so that the other, lesser disciples would not be scandalized. “The twelve,” among whom was Judas, so that he might warn him about his coming betrayal; and he warned the others so that they would not doubt his resurrection, as Saint Gregory says: “Our Redeemer, knowing that his disciples would be troubled because of his suffering, told them long beforehand both the torment of his passion and the glory of his resurrection, so that when they saw him die as he had told them, they would not doubt that he would also rise from the dead as he had told them.” And because the disciples, still fleshly, could not yet grasp the mystery in his words, he brought them to wonder by performing a miracle before their eyes, when he gave sight to the blind man in their presence, so that those who could not yet reach his hidden words would be strengthened in faith by heavenly works. So says Saint Gregory.

From this you see that he foretold his passion before he suffered it, for their confirmation. Likewise this reading is read to us today so that we will avoid sins and, keeping his passion in holy memory, be strengthened in good works.

Then you hear that he said to them: “Look, we are going up to Jerusalem” — that is, willingly, not unwillingly. In that he shows his great obedience to the Father, his deep humility, and his great mercy. “And everything will be fulfilled that has been written through the prophets,” that is, it will all be completed. It had been written about him by the prophets what he would do, what he would suffer, and what he would receive for both: for his own glorification and for our redemption. “For these things are written about the Son of Man,” that is, about Christ, who is the son of one human being, the Virgin Mary. What will be done? He says: “For he will be handed over to the Gentiles.”

Here understand that the Father gave him over to death, as Saint Paul says to the Romans, chapter 8, verse 32: “God did not spare his own special Son, but gave him up for us all” — that is, gave him over to death for us. He also gave himself for us, as Saint Paul says to the Ephesians, chapter 5, verse 2: “He gave himself for us as an offering.” Judas gave him over, as Saint Matthew says in chapter 26, verse 15, when he asked, “What will you give me, and I will betray him to you?” The bishops, priests, and scribes handed him over to Pilate to be killed, as Pilate said to him in John 18:35: “Your own people and your chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?” Finally Pilate gave him over to death, as Saint Luke says in chapter 23, verse 25: “He handed Jesus over, after he had him flogged, to do with him as they wished.”

Notice this: God the Father gave him over from great mercy for our salvation, and he gave himself; Judas gave him over out of great greed; and the priests with the bishops gave him over out of great envy. With Judas now stand today’s simoniacs and traitors and sellers of the truth; and with the priests and bishops stand the envious, who destroy those who preach God’s truth.

The reading goes on: “He will be mocked.” Understand that they mocked his wisdom in the house of the high priest Caiaphas when, after they had blindfolded him, they played mock games with him, as Luke says in chapter 22–23: “Prophesy, Christ! Who is it that struck you?” — just as children shout in a game when they blindfold someone and strike him: “Who hit you?” Second, they mocked his meekness in Herod’s house because he would not answer them as they wished. Therefore, Luke says in chapter 23, verse 11, Herod and his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him, and they dressed him in a bright robe to show that they considered him a fool. Third, they mocked his royal dignity before Pilate when they put a reed in his hand as a scepter, pressed a crown of thorns on his head, clothed him in a purple or gilded robe, knelt before him, struck him on the head with the reed, and said, “Hail, King of the Jews!” Then they spat in his face, as the Jews had done in Caiaphas’s house. Fourth, they mocked his power as they walked around the cross, crying out, as Mark 15:29–30 says: “Ha! You who would destroy the temple of God, save yourself!” And others, Mark 15:31: “He helped others; let him help himself!” And again, Matthew 27:43: “He trusted in God; let God rescue him now, if he wants him!” In this way they fulfilled the prophecy that he would be mocked.

Dear sons of Christ, does this not touch your hearts even now? The one who frees prisoners is betrayed; the glory of angels is made a joke; the Lord of the whole world is scourged; the spotless mirror and beauty of the eternal light is spat upon. And do you think he does not now suffer just as great opposition from evil Christians?

Saint Paul says to the Hebrews, chapter 6, verses 4–6, that those who were once enlightened and tasted the heavenly gift — that is, Christians who received baptism by faith and were enlightened by it, who heard the word of God and received his body — and then fall again into mortal sins, these crucify for themselves the Son of God a second time and treat him with contempt. So says Saint Paul.

And do not people now mock his wisdom in the houses of bishops, those who consider his way of life to be foolishness? Who is it that says to them: “Do not sell spiritual power, what is called the care of souls, the consecration of altars, churches, and oils, absolution, and the ordaining of clergy; for the Savior says in Matthew 10:8, ‘You received freely; freely give’”? And they immediately respond: “There is a heretic! There is a fool! He wants to teach us! Beat him, tear him down, throw him into a dark prison so that he will not teach us!” Are they not mocking his wisdom? He set things in order with great wisdom, and bishops make a mockery of it. What did he ordain? That bishops should not rule as secular lords, that they should not live in sexual immorality, that they should preach, that they should diligently lead the people to salvation.

Likewise, to our shame, in the houses of princes meek men are mocked, and in the courts of judges truth finds as much help as Christ found with Pilate! And this, to our shame, comes from the priests, because they themselves give princes an evil example, judging unjustly, not punishing them, not preaching to them, not advising them how to judge rightly, but rather teaching them how to smother the truth.

Just as the bishops, doctors, canons, abbots, parish priests, and scribes once handed out counsel to the secular lords in the town hall, or on the *rathaus*, about how to condemn many articles and how to drive other preachers away from preaching God’s word — so the doctors Palec, Stanislav, and others gave their advice, with Eliáš, Brod, Bora, and Šimon. But even though they have condemned the teaching that priests must not rule as secular lords, still the truth of the poor Christ stands firm, he who, not wanting to rule, said to his disciples in Luke 22:25–26: “The kings of the nations lord it over them, but you are not to be like that.”

And though they have condemned the teaching that tithes are true alms, yet even if they do not want to call them that, still in taking tithes they are receivers of alms; for they did not inherit them from their parents, they did not buy them, they did not earn them, they did not win them by casting lots — unless you say that some obtained them by buying church offices from the pope or from others. Yet tithes remain alms, given by the people for the praise of God and for souls. Therefore the poor souls groan for them, and these same priests, when anyone wants to harm their income, then they complain, they howl, they shout and preach that people are taking and destroying the poor souls’ goods from them. But when no one troubles them, then they call it lordship and dominion. Lords of the devil! Where have you been called by Christ to worldly lordship? Perhaps there, in Matthew 19:21: “If you want to be perfect, go, sell all that you have, give to the poor, and then come follow me.” About this word Saint Augustine says in *In lib. de contemptu mundi* that this is a special command for priests, canons, and monks. And Saint Bernard, writing to the pope called Eugenius, says that he must not rule as a worldly lord, and brings before him both the words of Saint Peter and those of Christ in Luke 22:25–26; and he says plainly about these words, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, but you are not to be like that,” and then he says clearly, “*Apostolóm zapovědieno jest panovánie*” — “rule is forbidden to the apostles.”

But now this is treated with mockery and contempt, from the time when, after more than three hundred years after Christ, the emperor Constantine supposedly gave worldly rule to the pope. And at that supposed donation a voice was heard: “Today poison has been poured into the Church of God.” They say the devil spoke it; and I say, whether it was an angel of God or the devil, still he spoke the truth! For by that unhappy wealth, which Christ calls “the mammon of wickedness” in Luke 16:9, almost all of Christendom has been poisoned and ruined in soul. From that source come quarrels between popes, between bishops, and between other priests. Dogs fight over a bone: take away the bone and they stop; take away wealth from the church, and you will find no princes fighting for it.

From where comes simony? From where this excessive pride in priests above the laity? From where their sexual sins? Surely from that poison. But the fleshly disciples of Christ — that is, those who follow Christ in order to feed their bodies: priests, monks, and students — these do not want to understand this! And how many fleshly men there are who became priests only so that they could be rich, honored by the people, have plenty to eat and drink, and live in pleasure! There would be no such excuse if all priests lived as Christ and his apostles did: content with simple clothing and with food and drink enough for need, as Saint Paul says in 1 Timothy 6:8: “If we have food and clothing, we will be content with that.”

The reading goes on: “And it happened that, as he drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.” According to Saint Gregory’s explanation, Jericho represents the defect, the weakness, of our flesh, which Jesus approached when the Son of God took on flesh and gave back to humankind the light that it had lost through sin. For since God humbled himself in the flesh, he raised humanity up to divine things. And this human being, as the reading shows, rightly sits blind and begging by the road. For Christ the Truth says in John 14:6: “I am the way.” So whoever does not know the light of eternal brightness is blind. But if he believes that Christ is the Redeemer, then he sits by the road. If he believes, but still delays in praying to Christ to receive the eternal light, then he is the blind man sitting by the road, but not yet asking to see the light. But if he believes and sits by the road and now begins to cry out from the heart, knowing his own darkness and desiring to see the light, then he cries out from the heart: “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”

Notice in the words, “A certain blind man was sitting by the roadside begging,” that spiritually four things are shown about our misery. First, blindness, in the word “blind.” Second, weakness, in the word “sitting.” Third, wandering, in the phrase “by the road.” Fourth, poverty, in the word “begging.” For because of sin a person is blind, weak, lost, and very poor — blind, because he does not truly know God; weak, because he does nothing spiritually good as he should; wandering, because he does not walk in God’s commandments, which are the road of God; and poor, because he has lost everything that he had. For when he commits a mortal sin, he loses God’s grace, and with it his soul, his body, and everything he had in grace, so that, as Saint Augustine says, he is not worthy to eat bread. For while he remains in mortal sin, he is a traitor and enemy of God, and not worthy to eat bread or to enjoy anything at all.

This could be proved even to an unbeliever: if he died in that sin, then worms would take his body, people would take his goods, and the devil would take his soul, and in hell he would not be able to enjoy anything he desired. The proof is in that rich man buried in hell, who could not obtain even a drop of water to satisfy his desire. Therefore the blind man must cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”

See also that this blind man confessed that Jesus is truly God and truly man when he called him, “Jesus,” and “Son of David.” In calling him “Jesus,” he showed that he is true God, for “Jesus,” as the angel Gabriel explained, means “Savior.” And in calling him “Son of David,” he confessed that he is true man. When he cried, “Have mercy on me,” he showed that he believed in his power and mercy; for if he did not consider him powerful, able to heal him, and merciful, willing to heal him, he would not have cried so earnestly to him, “Have mercy on me!”

Therefore Saint John Chrysostom says: “O man, you have not read books, you have no eyes; how then have you recognized the Light of the world?” And he himself answers: “Truly, the Lord enlightens the blind!”

Look also where this blind man received understanding to know Jesus: from hearing and from asking. For the reading says: “When he heard a crowd passing by, he asked what this might be.” Here we are taught that by asking and by hearing about Jesus people come to the knowledge of faith, and so to salvation, as Saint Paul proves to the Romans, chapter 10, verse 17: “Faith comes from hearing, and hearing cannot be without speaking or preaching.” “They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.” He is called Jesus of Nazareth because he was announced and brought up in Nazareth. “Nazareth” means “blooming,” and who ever blossomed more in virtue than Jesus?

“He began to cry out,” but more with his heart than with his mouth: “Jesus,” that is, Savior, and thus God; “Son of David,” and thus man; “have mercy,” showing his power and mercy; “on me,” who am miserable and in need of your mercy. “Those who went ahead of Jesus scolded him and told him to be quiet.”

O evil people, you hinder him from crying out to Jesus so that he would have mercy! Yet through David he says in Psalm 91:15: “He will call on me” — that is, the needy — “and I will hear him and exalt him.” The people of today strongly imitate that crowd when they hinder the name of Jesus Christ from being spoken, and when those are hateful to them who often love and name Jesus Christ. From the beginning of the Christian people until now, Christ’s name has never been so despised among Christians as it is now, especially by priests. Though they name Christ in their liturgical hours, yet they fiercely resist when they hear a preacher or another person often naming Christ. But the faithful Christian, not caring for this wretched, misleading crowd that goes ahead of Jesus, praising their own customs and commands more than those of Jesus, that Christian cries all the more from the heart without fear: “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” For there is no Scripture that tells of anyone who ever cried out to him in this way and was not heard.

It is remarkable that the bishops and priests, the scholars and scribes, did not like to call him “Jesus,” but instead “drunkard, glutton, sinner, demon-possessed, fool, deceiver, criminal, blasphemer” — that is, heretic — as the Scriptures show. So now they speak the same way about his faithful members, and thus about him, for he himself says in Matthew 25:45: “Whatever you have done to one of the least of these my brothers, you have done to me.”

“Jesus stopped and commanded that the man be brought to him.” By stopping, by commanding, by speaking, and by acting, merciful Jesus showed great compassion. O merciful Jesus, the blind man cannot walk to you, and yet you wait for him; people are hindering him from calling to you, and yet you command that he be brought! O compassionate Jesus, you value the voice of one blind man more than the voice of a great crowd!

O merciful Jesus, nowadays the pope, the archbishop, other prelates, or a king would not stand still for the cry of one blind beggar so as to have mercy on him and do what he truly cries for in truth. For Isaiah says, chapter 1, verse 23: “They do not judge the cause of the fatherless, and the case of the widow does not come before them.” Or if it does come, first they eat up what she has, or drag the case out for years so that little or nothing remains to her. They do not command that a poor person be brought to them, but rather that he be driven away. Nor do we easily find those who would bring the needy, especially sinners, to Jesus.

“When he had come near, Jesus asked him, ‘What do you want me to do for you?’” O merciful Jesus, you kindly waited for the blind beggar, you willingly questioned him, saying, “What do you want?” You sweetly and generously yielded yourself to his request, saying, “What do you want me to do for you?” You ask his will concerning himself. Do you mean to show that you do not heal those who do not call to you and do not desire your mercy, but you heal those who call, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me”? Therefore you urge him, not because you do not know what he wants, but because you want to be asked, so that he may lift up his heart to you, be stirred to a greater desire, and be comforted that you will hear him.

He said, “Lord, let me see again.” Notice the blind man’s request. At first he said, “Son of David,” but now he says “Lord,” as if to say: “As the Son of David you can have mercy, but you cannot give sight to the blind; but as Lord of the whole world, being the Son of God, you can give sight to the blind.” Therefore, as long as he cried, “Son of David, have mercy on me,” he did not yet receive his healing; but when he said, “Lord,” he was immediately healed, for he is the Lord who enlightens the blind. So when the blind man believed that he is that Lord, he at once said, “Lord, let me see!”

Here Saint Gregory says: “Look, this blind man asks the Lord not for gold but for light. He wants nothing but light. For whatever a blind person might possess, without light he cannot see what he has. Therefore, dearest brothers, let us follow him whose story we hear, how he was healed both in soul and in body. Let us ask from the Lord not false wealth, not earthly gifts, not perishable honors, but light — not the kind of light that can be shut up in a room, that will someday come to an end, that is cut off by nights, that is commonly seen by us sinners; but that light which we can see together with the angels, which has neither beginning nor end. And surely faith is the road to that light.” For just as Jesus immediately answered the blind man who was to be enlightened, “See again, your faith has healed you,” so faith is the way for us.

But then the thinking of the fleshly person says: “How can I seek spiritual light, since I cannot see it? It is uncertain whether it exists, since it does not shine into my bodily eyes.” The answer to this thought is: consider that it is your inner mind that thinks such things — not your body, but your soul — and no one doubts that he has a soul, though he does not see it. And from the invisible soul the visible body is directed and guided.

Now let us hear what happened to the blind man who asked, and what he did: the reading says, “Immediately he could see, and he followed him, glorifying God.” The one truly “sees and follows” who understands what is good and does it; but the one who “sees and does not follow” is the one who knows what is good and does not do it. So says Saint Gregory. “And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.”

Let us do the same. Seeing this work of Jesus, let us follow him in virtues, let us praise him and glorify him. If we have been blind in soul, sitting by the road and not on the road — and the road says, “I am the way” — if we have been beggars, unworthy of the bread of his holy body and even of bodily bread, let each of us cry out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” And together with one voice let us give praise to God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, who is God, blessed forever.
