# Second Reading For Church Consecration

The reading is from John 10:22.

“There was a feast of dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter.”

That’s what John writes in his gospel, chapter 10, verse 22. I have taken these words so I can say something about “dedication” – about this feast people remember, where many eat and drink themselves sick and sin in all kinds of ways, and by that they stand against the Lord Jesus.

Something very similar happened at that feast of dedication in Jerusalem.

That feast was the day when the people remembered the dedication of the temple Solomon had built for God. On that very festival, the Jews surrounded Jesus and said to him (John 10:24–25): “How long will you keep our souls in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us openly!” Jesus answered them, “I am speaking to you, and you do not believe.”  

Later John says (John 10:31) that the Jews picked up stones to stone him.

So, on the feast of dedication in Jerusalem, this happened to Jesus – Jesus who, as John says (John 10:23), “was walking in the temple area, in Solomon’s porch,” that is, in the very place where Solomon had once stood to pray. On the day when they celebrated the dedication of the temple, the Jews rushed at Jesus, wanted to stone him, wanted to seize him, as John writes (John 10:39). But he slipped out of their hands.

What does it mean to want to stone Jesus, if not this: to try to crush the truth?

But Jesus – and therefore the truth – hides himself from his enemies. He does not remain in unclean hearts. For as Paul writes to the Hebrews (Hebrews 6:4–6), those who have received the faith and the word of God, and then turn back to sins, “crucify the Son of God for themselves a second time and hold him up to contempt.”  

How much more those who know the truth and still resist it, who want to overthrow it – they are the ones who, together with the Jews, want to stone Jesus.

And there are many such people at church dedications today – especially among the priests. They gather in crowds, and they mock and accuse of heresy those who tell them the truth, just as the priests mocked Jesus and on the feast of the dedication of the Jerusalem temple wanted to stone him when he told them the truth.

So first, to know what people ought to think about “consecration,” understand this:

They remember the consecration of a church because a bishop or priest blessed that place so that in it honor and praise would be given to God; so that God’s word would be preached there and heard by the people; so that the Mass would be celebrated; so that those who pray might find forgiveness of sins and ask God for worthy things in that place.

You can read about this in 1 Kings 8, where Solomon, by God’s command, built the first temple and then consecrated it himself. He blessed all the people, prayed a most beautiful prayer, and made that day a great solemn feast for all the people with him. And the Jews kept a yearly memorial of that dedication in Jerusalem – that is why John says, “There was a feast of dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter.”

But understand also: the temple Solomon built was consecrated three times.

First, by Solomon himself (1 Kings 8).  
Second, by Zerubbabel (Ezra 10).  
Third, by Judas Maccabeus (1 Maccabees 4:41–54).

And that same temple was defiled by three men.

First, by King Jeroboam, who made two golden calves, one in Dan and the other in Bethel (1 Kings 12:28–29). He did it out of greed. He is a picture of greedy priests, through whom Christianity has been greatly polluted.

Second, by Nebuzaradan, commander of the army of the king of Babylon, the chief of his cooks. He burned the temple in Jerusalem (2 Kings 25:8–9). He is a picture of those who live in gluttony and indulgence.

Third, by King Antiochus, who was very proud. He set up an idol in the temple, burned the books of God’s law, and killed everyone who refused to worship his idol (1 Maccabees 1:23–60). He is a picture of the proud in the church, whom people treat like idols; and in their pride they destroy those who refuse to bow to them, and they even burn the books that speak against their wickedness.

So you see: the temple Solomon built was consecrated three times and defiled three times.

And do not people today defile God’s temples and churches on the very day of their dedication? Proud and greedy people who bring their pride and greed right into the house of God and turn it into a den of robbers?

That is exactly what the Savior said to the priests when he threw down their money and overturned their tables (Luke 19; John 2; Isaiah 56:7): “It is written: ‘My house shall be a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a den of robbers!”

So the Savior himself shows that a church is a house of prayer – a place established and consecrated for prayer. Therefore people ought to do nothing there except what is according to God’s will and to his praise.

Now you see what “the consecration of a church” means: first, the blessing of a church so that God may be praised there. Second, “consecration” also means the festival – the feast day on which people remember that blessing.

And understand this too: there is a difference between *posvěcení* and *posviecení*. *Posviecení* means the “showing of lights,” an illumination; *posvěcení* means, as I said, the blessing of the church, or the feast day when that blessing is remembered, as people commonly keep it.

It is about that feast that John says, “There was a feast of dedication in Jerusalem.” That is: there was a memorial feast of the dedication of the temple, which the Maccabees had celebrated when they cleansed the temple from the pagans and consecrated it again (1 Maccabees 4:43–54).

Now those three consecrations of Solomon’s temple point to three consecrations of Christ’s temple.

Christ’s temple is especially the assembly of those chosen for salvation.

For Augustine says, *De civit. lib. 10*: “We are all together the temple of God.” And Paul says (1 Corinthians 3:16), “Do you not know that you are God’s temple?”

This temple – the people of God – has been consecrated by Christ, the true Solomon, in three ways:

First, on the cross, when he stretched out his hands.  
Second, after defilement, through holy repentance in many people.  
Third, on the day of resurrection, when he will confirm the entire temple and every living stone in perfect holiness, so that neither the temple nor any stone of it can ever again be defiled.

In that day the salvation of this temple – this house – will be complete. Christ will show then that salvation has truly come to this house: to the whole assembly of the elect.

Now in the gospel reading from Luke that is used at church dedications, there is mention of a house, when Christ says to Zacchaeus (Luke 19:5), “Today I must stay at your house.” And a spiritual house is more precious to God than all stone or wooden houses and churches in the whole world.

So I want to speak briefly about that spiritual house. For without doubt, everyone who has a good spiritual house will have Christ graciously come to him.

There are two kinds of spiritual houses, as Christ lays out in Matthew 7:24–27 and Luke 6:48–49.

The first spiritual house is the house of virtues founded on Christ.  
The second is the unstable house built on created things.

About the first house the Savior speaks in Luke 6:47–48:

“Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like. He is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on rock. When the flood came, the river beat against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built on the rock.”

That is the firm spiritual house.

Then Christ says (Luke 6:49):

“But the one who hears and does not do is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The river beat against it; it collapsed at once, and that house fell with a great crash.”

That is the second house.

For the first house to be completed, three things are needed.

First, “the way” must be set in order: a person must *go* to Jesus by following him in virtue.  
Second, he must *hear* the word of Christ.  
Third, he must *do* what that word commands.

No one will be saved unless he keeps these three things.

For how could anyone be saved without following Christ in virtue? No one will be saved except the one who is virtuous; and no one can be truly virtuous unless he follows Christ, the first leader.

That is the first part: a person must first go to Jesus.

The second: every article of the faith is a word of Jesus. And since no one can be saved without faith, it follows that no one can be saved unless he at least in his understanding holds to every article of the faith and hears it with the inner ear.

The deaf who are born deaf – if they are saved, they “hear” the word of God in this inner way.

That is the second thing needed for salvation.

The third: everyone who will be saved must courageously carry out what God’s word commands.

These are the three things Christ means when he says (Luke 6:47), “Everyone who comes to me” – that is, in virtue; “and hears my words” – that is the second; “and does them” – that is the third.

So if anyone is to be saved, he must believe in Christ, hear his word inwardly, and do it in action until death.

For this he must firmly build the house of virtue on Christ, the solid rock.

So Christ says (Matthew 7:24), “Everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.”

That rock is Christ, as Paul says (1 Corinthians 10:4). On him the spiritual house must be founded; otherwise that house cannot stand against temptation in the end. Just as a physical house without a solid foundation will not stand against wind and flood, neither will a soul.

Every person who will be saved must have this spiritual house – this gathering of virtues. Christ calls that house a tower in Luke 14:28, and since this house must be built very high, right up to heaven itself, it must also be very firm and set on a very firm rock.

And since no one can lay any other foundation for that house except the foundation which is Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 3:11), whoever wants to build this spiritual house must “dig deep” in understanding.

For God in his depth is deeper than any abyss; he contains in himself every depth, breadth, length, and height.

So a person digs with his mind until he knows that Christ is the immeasurable God and the highest good. Then he must lay on this rock faith, hope, and love.

Faith must be like the beginning of the spiritual house, for without faith it is impossible to please God (Hebrews 11:6). Faith is like the first flooring laid upon the rock.

And since a four-sided house stands firm, hope must rise from that faith and form four walls:

The first wall of the spiritual house of believers is on the east: the hope of being chosen for salvation – believers should trust that they are chosen for salvation.  

The second wall is on the west: the hope of eternal satisfaction at the last supper of the Lamb. That wall must especially be lifted high when a person draws near to death.  

The third wall is on the north: the hope of being freed from eternal damnation.  

The fourth wall is on the south: the hope of enjoying eternal joy in Christ.

These are the four walls of the spiritual house of faithful Christians:  

that they hope they are chosen;  
that they will be eternally satisfied;  
that they will be freed from eternal condemnation;  
and that they will finally be seated in everlasting joy.

When believers hope like this, then they are rich in hope – they have built very high four walls upon the floor of faith.

Then comes the virtue of the Holy Spirit that never falls – love. Love is like the roof that covers and completes that spiritual house in faithful Christians.

So the spiritual house of believers is built on Christ, the solid rock, because they believe in him, hope in him, and love him above all. They come to him, listen to his word, and do it.

Each of them is like the wise man – like Jesus says (Luke 6:47–48): “Everyone who comes to me, and hears my words and does them, is like a wise man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on rock. When the flood came, the river beat against that house, and could not shake it, because it was founded on rock.”

Since this house is built on Christ the Rock – whom no one can move – it cannot fall, no matter what temptation crashes against it. Even if the river of adversity or the stream of bodily weakness beats on its walls, as long as the roof – love – holds the walls together, that house will not be moved, because it rests on a rock that nothing can shake.

Christ says the same in Matthew 7:27: “The rain fell, the floods came, the winds blew and beat against that house, but it did not fall, because it was founded on the rock.”

Whoever comes to Christ, learns his law, and in action fully does what he commands, is like a wise builder. He builds all his works on Christ, doing everything for him and according to his will.

So when the rain of God’s chastening or testing falls, and floods – that is, human oppositions and bodily stirrings – rise, and the winds of pride, envy, greed, and anger blow, this house still stands firm. Virtues overcome sins when they stand on such a foundation.

Then a person can say, as Job said (Job 2:10): “If we have received good things from God’s hand, why should we not also endure evil?”

Now you have seen what this good spiritual house is: a gathering of virtues founded on Christ by faith, hope, and love.

Whoever is a Christian and has built such a house is a true Christian. To him Christ says, just as to Zacchaeus (Luke 19:5), “Today I must stay at your house.”

To know this house more clearly, understand:

Faith is holding with your mind to God’s truth which you cannot see. To believe is to come with your understanding to a truth you do not see – for example, that the Son of God became flesh, was born of a virgin, suffered, and so on; that the Holy Trinity is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – three Persons and one God.

Hope is expecting eternal joy, which comes from God’s grace and from the merits he works in us. Whoever lives well and, trusting in God’s grace, expects blessedness – that one has true hope.

Love is God’s gift that makes a person precious to God.

Therefore no one who is in mortal sin has truly built this spiritual house on Christ by faith, hope, and love – even if he thinks he believes, hopes, and loves.

Against such people stands Paul’s word to Titus (Titus 1:16): “They profess to know God, but by their works they deny him.”

Such people do not have the living faith of God’s grace. As James says (James 2:26), “Faith without works is dead” – that is, useless for salvation. He goes on (James 2:19): “Even the demons believe – and tremble.”

Sinners in mortal sin have already broken the very foundation; David calls them “faithless sons” (Psalm 144:7,11). It would be better for them never to have received the faith than, having received it, to be faithless to God.

The same is true of hope. Since their lives are evil and they are unfaithful to God, they do not hope virtuously but wrongly. Being traitors to God, they still expect from him eternal reward without any true merit. They have not truly grounded their hope in Christ.

As for love, it is obvious that mortal sinners do not have it, because they do not love God. John says (1 John 2:3–4, 20): “Whoever says ‘I know him’ but does not keep his commandments is a liar.” And if someone says he loves God but does not keep his commandments, he also is a liar.

So many people deceive themselves, imagining that they have built a spiritual house on Christ by faith, hope, and love, while in fact the devil has already torn the whole building down through mortal sin.

Furthermore, understand that whoever has this spiritual house built on Christ by faith, hope, and love – so that he goes toward Christ in all three – must then make that house beautiful.

He spreads on the floor of faith the virtue of humility. He strengthens the four walls of hope with four virtues, so that:

Justice is on the wall toward the rising sun (east).  
Courage (fortitude) is on the wall toward the north.  
Temperance (self-control) is on the wall toward the south.  
Prudence is on the wall toward the setting sun (west).

So whoever has built his house on Christ is humble, just, courageous, temperate, and prudent. It is impossible for someone with true faith, hope, and love to be proud, unjust, cowardly, intemperate, and imprudent.

For whoever has love is clean from every mortal sin. Such a person is not proud but humble, having laid his humility on Christ, who says (Matthew 11:29): “Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart.”

He commands us to learn from his humility and from that to grow in all the other virtues. For just as pride is the beginning of every sin (Ecclesiasticus 10:13), so that the devil first sinned through pride, and no one can commit mortal sin without first despising God by refusing to keep his command, so if anyone is to be truly virtuous he must begin from humility. Humility is the foundation of all virtues.

So the Son of God was made flesh in the humility of a pure virgin. Just as Christ could not possibly be proud, so no one can be humbler than he. Our humility must be founded on his humility, as on the lowest floor.

Do not be troubled if you say: “Then Christ would be beneath us as a floor – how could he still be the highest?”

You know he says (Matthew 23:12): “Whoever humbles himself will be exalted.” Christ, as man, humbled himself more than anyone; therefore God exalted him more than all. So he is both lowest and highest: lowest in humility – that is, most humble; highest in dignity – that is, most exalted.

Paul writes to the Philippians (Philippians 2:8–11):

“He humbled himself by becoming obedient to death – even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and given him the name above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow – in heaven and on earth and under the earth – and every tongue confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.”

You hear how he humbled himself through obedience to the Father: he served us, accepted suffering and dishonor, and died according to the Father’s will – not a light death, but a cruel death on the cross.

Because he humbled himself more than all, the Father exalted him above all and gave him “the name above every name” – that is, the very being and office of “Jesus,” which, as the angel explained to Joseph (Matthew 1:20–21), means “Savior”:

“Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son; you shall call his name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”

The angel explains why he is called Jesus: because he will save his people from their sins. “Jesus” therefore means “Savior.” There is no other name by which anyone can be saved except Jesus.

So Peter, as Luke records (Acts 4:7–10), stood before the bishops and priests when they questioned the apostles: “By what power or by what name have you done this?” – that is, when they had been preaching and healing the sick.

Peter answered that it was by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom they had crucified. Then he added (Acts 4:12): “There is no other name under heaven given among people by which we must be saved.”

This name – this office of Savior almighty – the Father has given him. It is the name above every name, so that at the name of “Jesus” – that is, for the sake of this almighty Savior – every knee should bow: the powers of heaven (angels), of earth (people), and of hell (demons).

This is a great exaltation!

And every tongue must confess – as all will confess on the last day – that Jesus Christ the Lord is in the glory of God the Father; that he is as glorious in his divinity as the Father, and as man he surpasses in glory every creature.

So Christ stands in complete opposition to the devil. Christ is most humble and most glorious; the devil is most proud and most miserable.

If you want to be pleasing to God, do not be proud. Then your house will stand so firmly that pride, anger, envy, and sexual sin will not be able to shake it.

Just as all later sins grow from the one corrupt root of the proud devil, so all virtues and the salvation of every person grow from Christ as the first good root.

To understand the spiritual house more clearly, know this:

Humility is the virtue by which someone loves to remain rightly ordered in the state God has given.

So a person is not proud who gladly wants to be wherever God’s order and will put him – here and in heaven – and who wants to be as holy as he possibly can. Yet he should not place himself above any saint while he still lives here, thinking he is holier than they. On Christ’s wedding feast he must always take the last place – that is, he must hope that he is at least the least among those chosen for salvation.

Justice is the virtue by which a person gives to each what belongs to him.

So a person is just when he gives God the greatest honor, praise, and love, and when he wishes for his neighbor whatever he would rightly wish for himself in the same situation.

Prudence is the virtue by which a person rightly guides all his actions so that he does nothing against God.

Fortitude is the virtue by which a person stands firm for God’s truth and glory, willing to suffer gladly even unto death rather than turn away from God’s truth.

Temperance is the virtue by which a person uses food and drink as sound reason commands.

So, knowing these virtues, you can briefly build the spiritual house on Christ in this way:

First, have faith: believe *him*, believe *what he says*, and believe *in him*.

Believe *him* – that is, believe that he is God.  
Believe *what he says* – that whatever he says is truth.  
Believe *in him* – that is, love him above all other things.

When you have that faith, you also have hope – that for that faith you will be saved, hoping that you are God’s chosen child.

Then immediately you cover it all with love: you love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.

Doing this, you will at once be humble, following Christ. Since you cannot do that without justice, you give God the highest love and praise and give your neighbor what belongs to him – then you have justice.

You cannot do this without prudence, by which you rightly guide all your works – then you have prudence.

You would not truly be prudent if you were not also courageous: ready to suffer for the truth even to death. So you must have fortitude.

You would not be truly courageous if you let yourself be defeated by gluttony, drunkenness, or sexual sin. Therefore, after fortitude, you must also have temperance.

Having these virtues by God’s grace, you have built a spiritual house on Christ that is worth more than all stone and wooden houses in this world.

No one can have this house unless he first receives God’s grace. And just as no one in this world can know for certain without revelation whether he is in God’s grace and free from mortal sin, so no one can know without revelation whether he has truly built this spiritual house on the Lord Jesus – who is both the first foundation of this house, and the door, and the carpenter and builder. Without him, as he himself says (John 15:5), we can do nothing.

A house without windows is not bright. So in this spiritual house there are five windows:

The first: the eye – right seeing.  
The second: the ear – true obedience.  
The third: the nose – the power to distinguish between the stench of sin and the fragrance of virtue.  
The fourth: the mouth – tasting the goodness of God.  
The fifth: touch – the public doing of good deeds that can be seen.

An empty house, with no one living in it, is abandoned and useless. It is not fitting to leave such a good house empty; indeed, it cannot be empty if it is so rightly built.

So to Zacchaeus – whose name means “made righteous” – Christ says (Luke 19:5), “Today I must stay at your house.”

Christ cannot be alone in that house. He says (John 14:23), “Whoever loves me will keep my word, and my Father will love him; and we will come to him and make our home with him.”

The Father and the Son cannot be without the Holy Spirit; therefore the Holy Spirit also dwells in that house. Paul says to believers (1 Corinthians 3:16), “You are God’s temple, and the Holy Spirit dwells in you.”

The Holy Spirit is very generous, very merciful, and the greatest Comforter. He never stays in a house without giving great gifts. When he comes, he immediately gives seven gifts:

Fear of the Lord,  
Goodness (piety),  
Knowledge,  
Fortitude,  
Counsel,  
Understanding,  
Wisdom.

He gives fear so that a person may fear God and turn away from evil.  

He gives goodness so that a person may forgive his neighbor.  

He gives knowledge so that a person may know what he must punish by the judgment of justice, and what he must forgive by mercy.  

He gives fortitude so that a person may strongly do the good he knows and not fall away from it because of threat or fear.  

He gives counsel so that fortitude does not rush blindly ahead; counsel first watches carefully and shows what fortitude ought to do.  

He gives understanding so that a person may see what is better – how evil burdens a person and how good strengthens him.  

He gives wisdom so that, together with temperance, it may hold understanding steady and weighty.

So the person who has built a spiritual house for the Holy Trinity is enriched with these seven gifts of the Holy Spirit:

By fear, he is humble.  
By goodness, he is merciful.  
By knowledge, he is discerning and perceptive.  
By fortitude, he is free and bold.  
By counsel, he is cautious (*cautus*), warned beforehand.  
By understanding, he is prudent.  
By wisdom, he is serious, weighty, and lifted up toward God.

Because of these gifts, that house is very pure from mortal sin.

The first gift, fear, drives out pride.  
The second, goodness, drives out envy.  
The third, knowledge, drives out anger, which makes a person like a crazed fool.  
The fourth, fortitude, drives out sloth.  
The fifth, counsel, drives out greed.  
The sixth, understanding, drives out covetous desire.  
The seventh, wisdom, drives out sexual sin.

These gifts not only drive out the seven mortal sins; they also make a person blessed.

Fear makes people “poor in spirit” – not puffed up, proud, lifted up, or self-important. About them the Savior says (Matthew 5:3): “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”

The second gift, goodness, makes people meek – not vengeful, not quick to anger, not easily stirred up. To them Christ says (Matthew 5:5): “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.”

The third gift, knowledge, makes people mourn. Whoever has understood how the devil has overcome him by sin, and what good he has lost, will mourn and weep. About such mourners Christ says (Matthew 5:4): “Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.”

The fourth gift, fortitude, makes people hunger and thirst for righteousness. The courageous long intensely that God’s truth will not be crushed, and that they may reach eternal joy. About them the Savior says (Matthew 5:6): “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.”

The fifth gift, counsel, belongs especially to the merciful. For it is great counsel when a person advises himself to forgive his neighbor mercifully if he wants God to forgive him; and to do good to his neighbor so that good may also be done to him. To the merciful Christ says (Matthew 5:7): “Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.”

The sixth gift, understanding, belongs especially to the pure in heart. With a pure understanding they see what no bodily eye has seen. To them Christ says (Matthew 5:8): “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”

The seventh gift, wisdom, belongs especially to the peacemakers – those in whom wisdom has ordered all things, so that there is no movement in them against sound reason. Their spirit is fully submitted to God, and their body to their spirit. About them Christ says (Matthew 5:9): “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”

So you see: the Holy Spirit brings seven gifts into this spiritual house, by which he drives out the seven mortal sins and brings in the seven beatitudes. That is why they are especially called “the gifts of the Holy Spirit,” even though everything good that God gives is a gift of the Holy Spirit.

For such a house everyone should strive with all his powers – mind, will, and memory – so that he may dwell in that house forever.

About this house David the prophet says (Psalm 84:4): “Blessed are those who dwell in your house, O Lord; they will be praising you forever and ever.”

May the almighty Savior grant all his elect to share in that eternal praise in that house, as he has helped to complete this simple exposition of all the Sunday readings – so that God’s lovers may have food for their souls on Sundays, that their understanding may be lifted up, and that in thinking, reading, and speaking in this way they may be pleasing to God through the merits of our Lord Jesus Christ.

This exposition of the holy readings was finished, by his help, in the year of our Lord 1413, on the fast day of the holy apostles Simon and Jude, at the castle called Kozí.

Amen.
