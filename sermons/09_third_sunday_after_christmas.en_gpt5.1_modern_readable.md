# Third Sunday After Christmas

From John 2:1–11

“At that time a wedding feast was held in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus also was invited to the wedding, together with his disciples. When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, ‘They have no wine.’ Jesus said to her, ‘Woman, what is that to me and to you? My hour has not yet come.’ His mother said to the servants, ‘Do whatever he tells you.’ Now there were six stone water jars standing there, used for the Jewish washings, each holding two or three measures. Jesus said to them, ‘Fill the jars with water.’ And they filled them up to the brim. Then he said to them, ‘Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.’ So they took it. When the master of the feast tasted the water that had become wine, not knowing where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called the bridegroom and said to him, ‘Everyone sets out the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the inferior. But you have kept the good wine until now!’ This, the beginning of his miracles, Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and he revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.”

This reading tells of a miracle that took place, as is held, on the very same calendar day, one year after Christ was baptized by John—at a wedding feast. Many think this was the wedding of John, who was then called to be an apostle. We do not know who his bride was; some suppose it was Mary Magdalene.

So, on the third day after the calling of Philip and Nathanael—as you can read in John chapter 1, verses 44–52—in that little Galilean town called Cana, this miracle happened. The mother of Jesus was there at the wedding, for, as they say, she was John’s aunt, and by natural affection she was bound to be present. And Jesus too, as a natural friend—and because he lived a common human life—was invited with his disciples.

From this we can clearly see that marriage is honorable, and a wedding feast is honorable too. For if there were anything evil in marriage itself, the highest Truth, the Lord Jesus, would never have attended a wedding feast.

So Saint Bede says: Jesus chose to come to this wedding, as the Scripture lays out, to confirm the faith of believers and to put to shame the errors of the heretics Tatian, Marcion, and others, who despised marriage. If marriage, kept pure and uncorrupted, and the wedding feast, rightly held, were sinful, the Lord would by no means have gone to that wedding.

Yet, although marriage is good, he also shows that marital self-control is good, widowhood with self-control is better, and perfect virginity is best. He proved that the state of virginity is most worthy by choosing to be born of the Virgin Mary. That is how Bede explains it.

When the wine ran short, the mother of Jesus—watchful and compassionate—spoke to her Son out of concern, trusting that he could make up the lack by a miracle. She spoke gently and briefly: “They have no wine.”

And Jesus answered her, “Woman, what is that to me and to you? My hour has not yet come.”

It is as if he said, according to the explanation of Saint Augustine: “I did not take my humanity from you so that I would work every kind of miracle by that humanity, for I work miracles according to my divinity, which you did not give me.” For this reason he says, “My hour has not yet come”—the hour in which he would suffer according to the humanity he took from her. So in this Gospel, as in John 20:15, he calls her “Woman,” as Augustine notes.

But Saint John Chrysostom thinks Mary, from compassion, wanted Christ to work a miracle *before* the proper time—but without sin on her part. She asked modestly and would only desire it if it were his will. And because this miracle was the first public one, Christ wanted it to be open and clear, and at the right time.

So he did not answer her harshly, but seriously and for our instruction: “My hour has not yet come”—the hour suitable for this act. Since neither for him nor for his mother had the full, fitting time for the miracle come, he calls her “Woman,” as if she were a stranger in this matter and not the one from whom he took direction about *when* to act. He was not to learn from her *the hour* in which to perform a miracle, but was to wait for the hour that was most fitting and most open for that miracle.

Mary did not take this in her heart as if he had rejected her prayer or refused to hear her. She understood that he was delaying in a wise way, to fulfill her request in the best time. For she knew with full faith that Christ is all-powerful and all-knowing, and that everything he does, he does most rightly.

So, having entrusted in her mind the whole matter and all its causes to his will, believing that if it was good he would remedy the lack of wine, she said to the servants, “Whatever he tells you to do, do it.”

If only we, who call ourselves servants of Christ, would listen to this holy counsel of his mother! Then we would not live in sexual immorality, nor commit any mortal sin. We would completely do the will of his holy commandments.

The text goes on: “There were six stone water jars there.” These were large containers; I cannot say exactly which kind—the Latin *hydria* comes from the Greek and means a vessel prepared for water. So these six vessels—whatever their exact form, whether jars, tubs, barrels, buckets, pails, flasks, or basins—stood there according to Jewish custom.

That custom had been laid down by the teachers of the Law: they required frequent washing of hands, even when touching things already quite clean, and also frequent washing of all vessels. As Saint Mark writes in chapter 7, verses 3–4:

“The Pharisees and all the Jews, unless they wash their hands often, do not eat, holding to the traditions of the elders. And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions that they have received to keep, such as washing cups, pitchers, copper vessels, and dining couches.”

So says Mark.

The reading continues: each jar held “two or three measures” (*metretae*). What exactly that is in our measures I cannot say. *Metreta* is a Greek word, and one country has one set of measures, another country another. Even here in Bohemia we are not unified in our measures; in one city, Prague, there is one measure in the New Town, another in the Lesser Town. And it is not very useful for our salvation to know exactly what size those stone jars were or how large their measures.

“Jesus said to them, ‘Fill the jars with water.’”

Someone might ask, “Why didn’t he create wine in the jars without water—or create the water in the jars without human help?”

John Chrysostom answers: he did it this way so that the servants would be witnesses of the miracle. Just as when he raised Lazarus (John 11:39), he ordered the stone to be taken away—though everyone knows he could just as easily have raised Lazarus without moving the stone as with it.

“And they filled them up to the brim.”

Those servants obeyed Mary and obeyed Christ. May God grant that we would do the same.

But sadly, many do the opposite. They do not fill themselves according to Christ’s command, but fill their bellies with gluttony, making their stomach their god, as Paul says to the Philippians (3:19). Others fill themselves with the “water” of greed—desires for riches—which they can never drink enough to satisfy; the more they drink, the more they thirst. For Solomon says (Ecclesiastes 5:10) that the greedy person will not be satisfied with money. And Aristotle says the desire for wealth grows without end.

Then Jesus says: “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.”

He says this so that the miracle will be made known by the servants and by the master of the feast—that one who in Greek is called *architriclinus*, the one who managed the wedding banquet. Some say that, according to Jewish custom, this was a priest assigned to weddings to instruct the bridegroom and the bride how they should live together.

The text continues simply: “They took it.”

Up to this point everything is easy to understand. Then comes: “This, the beginning of his miracles, Jesus did in Cana of Galilee.”

Someone might say, “But didn’t he do miracles earlier—when he drew the three kings to himself by a star, or when he taught the teachers in the temple?”

One answer is: the reading says this was the first miracle he did *in Cana of Galilee*. Another answer is better: this miracle was the first *open*, public miracle from the beginning of his preaching by which he revealed, or announced, his glory—that is, that he is God, mighty and glorious. And because of this work, “his disciples believed in him.” They had already believed before, but here their faith was confirmed.

**B.** Because this reading is about a wedding, it is often read around carnival-time, when people commonly marry and hold many weddings. So it is useful for priests to preach to the people about how they should enter marriage and how they should live in it rightly.

They should teach the people that marriage was established first of all for children—for offspring. For God said to Noah and his sons (Genesis 9:1), “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.” And he brought Eve to Adam in Paradise (Genesis 2:22) so that the human race would be multiplied from them. So marriage began in Paradise and was instituted by God.

Let any monk try to show as strong a foundation for his rule as holy marriage has for itself!

The second reason marriage was established is as a safeguard against sexual immorality, as Paul says in 1 Corinthians 7:2: “Because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.” Paul says this not as a command for all, but as counsel for those who do not want to remain in virginity or in the purity of widowhood.

Understand this well: when Paul says, “Let each man have his own wife because of sexual immorality,” he does not mean, “so that he may commit sexual immorality with her,” but, “so that, having his own wife, he may be kept from sexual immorality.” So children and protection from sexual sin are the two chief reasons for ordinary marriage.

I say “ordinary” marriage, because between Joseph and the Virgin Mary there was a true marriage, but not so that he would have children by physical union, nor as a remedy for their lust, but for other reasons that I explain elsewhere.

There are also other purposes of marriage: to reconcile enemies, to bind families together, and similar things.

The benefit of marriage is this: if husband and wife live together rightly, God will give them good children and other blessings—and afterward, the kingdom of heaven.

In marriage there must be faithfulness, fruitfulness, and a sacred sign. Faithfulness, so that neither the husband breaks marriage with another woman, nor the wife with another man. Fruitfulness, so that any children are raised to the praise of God. And the sacred sign—what is that? It is that the union of husband and wife points to a holy reality: the union of Christ, the Son of God, with his bride, the holy Church, which is the assembly of all the elect who will be saved.

Christ so loved this bride that he died for her on the cross. He loved her rightly—for her salvation. In the same way, husbands should love their wives.

**C.** So Paul says to the Ephesians (5:25–26): “Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the Church and gave himself for her”—that is, to death—“to make her glorious, cleansing her by the washing of water with the word of life.” That is, by the washing of water of the Son of God—the water that flowed from his side.

Then Paul goes on (Ephesians 5:27): “So that he might present the Church to himself in glory, without stain or wrinkle or anything like that, but that she might be holy and without blemish.”

Understand this: Christ wants to have this bride, the Church, glorious—in soul and in body—after the day of judgment. “Without stain,” that is, without mortal sin; “without wrinkle,” that is, without daily venial sins; “or anything like that,” that is, without any uncleanness in the body or any defect. So she will be holy and without blemish.

Then Paul adds (Ephesians 5:28): “In the same way, husbands should love their wives.” “In the same way”—that is, as Christ loves the Church—“toward eternal salvation.”

And he continues (Ephesians 5:28–32): “As their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the Church. For we are members of his body, from his flesh and from his bones. Therefore a man will leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two will be one flesh. This mystery is great—but I am speaking about Christ and the Church.”

All that is from Paul.

This is a hard saying for simple people to understand. Yet hear it briefly: the union of husband and wife in marriage, so that they may have children, is a sign of the union of Christ with the holy Church for spiritual birth.

A husband and wife beget physical children; Christ and his bride, the Church, beget spiritual children. And as Christ loves the Church towards purity and salvation, so a husband ought to love his wife, and a wife her husband. And as Christ is one body with the holy Church and loves her as his own body, so husband and wife ought to be as one body and love one another.

When Paul says (Ephesians 5:30), “We are members of his body,” he means of the holy Church, which is called the body of Christ. Understand: not the physical body that he himself has in his person and which hung on the cross, but, as Paul often speaks, the whole assembly of people who will be saved. Each of the elect is a member of that body.

And when he says, “Therefore”—that is, because of this mystery shown in marriage—“a man will leave his father and mother,” so also the woman, “and the man will cling to his wife and the wife to her husband.”

“Leave,” that is, in dwelling: he will depart from father and mother and live with his wife, and she with him. “And the two will be one flesh,” that is, counted as one person. And this is the sign of a great holy reality: the union of Christ with the holy Church.

About this I have written in my books on the commandments and in my little books on the holy Church.

**D.** Know also: marriage is an ordered covenant of man and woman, unbreakable until death.

When I say “ordered,” I mean that there must be freedom on both sides. The man and the woman must both be free—bound by no promise to another man or woman, and not bound to God by a vow of celibacy.

“Ordered” also means they must not be too closely related by blood—within the forbidden degrees of kinship—and not within certain relationships of in‑law or spiritual kinship, such as between a man and his daughter‑in‑law, or his sister‑in‑law, or his son‑in‑law, or between godparents and godchildren, and similar ties.

When I say “covenant,” know that this covenant—this consent of both parties—*makes* a true marriage. When a woman and a man, without deceit, give each other their consent to live together as husband and wife, then there is already between them an unbreakable marital bond, as Scripture says (Matthew 19:6): “What God has joined together, let no human separate.”

I say “without deceit,” because sometimes a man will promise marriage with his lips deceitfully, just to get a woman to agree to sexual relations, while in his heart he does not intend to marry her. She believes him to be sincere and gives her consent. In that case there is not a true marriage, and he could lawfully marry another woman later—though if he made his promise under an oath, he would be a perjurer before God.

But that woman, not knowing whether he truly meant it or not, must not marry another man while he lives, because she cannot be sure whether his promise was honest. Nor should she believe him if he tells her afterward, “I never meant to marry you.”

Deceit can happen from the woman’s side as well.

So it is the mutual, free, and honest consent that makes a marriage—even if the couple never lie together. Yet common people often think one-sided consent or mere intercourse is what makes a marriage.

Consent is strengthened and made clear by spoken words on both sides. For example, the man says, “I take you as my wife.” And she replies, “And I take you as my husband.” Or, if they do not know this form, they might say, “I promise to take you as my wife and promise not to take another.” And she replies in the same way.

Who then has the right to separate what such sincere consent and such words have joined?

This covenant is unbreakable until the death of one of them. Neither one can revoke it, and no one can dissolve it so that they cease to be husband and wife. Sometimes they may be separated from living together outwardly because of adultery, but even then the bond of marriage itself is not broken.

**E.** Know also that husbands and wives can come together in the marriage act in four, or really five, different ways.

First, directly and simply for children—for offspring. In that case, confession is not required on that account alone, though, according to Augustine, that act never happens without at least a small daily sin. He says that in that moment the human being is sunk down into animal passion and so forgets God for a time.

You might say, “If that’s so, then should married people never come together even for children?” By that same reasoning, you could argue that we should never say the Lord’s Prayer, the ‘Our Father.’ For none of us says it without some daily sin—either because our thoughts wander, or because we say it without great earnestness, and certainly because none of us ever prays it as perfectly as Christ did. So each of us is lacking in our prayer.

I admit this about myself—you may do as you choose. I do not know if, as long as I have lived, I have ever prayed even one ‘Our Father’ in a way fully pleasing to God.

Scripture itself is witness, saying (Ecclesiastes 9:1): “No one knows whether he is worthy of love or of hatred”—that is, whether he stands in God’s favor or in his anger. And Saint John writes in his epistle (1 John 1:8): “If we say we have no sin”—that is, no daily sin—“we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.”

**F.** But understand this clearly: daily sin—called “daily” because we have it every day until death, as we never love God *with all* our strength perfectly—daily sin does *not* drive the Holy Spirit away from us, nor does it make our works displeasing to God.

So if a person prays the ‘Our Father’ while having such daily sins, but not mortal sin, that prayer is pleasing to God and will have a reward. Likewise, when husband and wife come together for children with that same measure of daily imperfection, that act is accepted and has its place.

Second: spouses may come together to avoid sin. A husband, fearing that he might fall into fornication or adultery, yields to the sexual act with his wife. This again is without mortal sin and does not of itself require confession.

Third: they come together out of obedience to the law of marriage, to pay the “debt,” as Paul teaches in 1 Corinthians 7:3–4: “Let the husband give his wife what he owes her, and likewise the wife to her husband. For the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. Likewise, the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does.”

So when the husband requests and the wife, even if she would rather abstain, consents out of obedience to this law, she is paying the debt and fulfilling the law; and the husband must also do the same for the wife. Paul clearly confirms this third way.

Fourth: spouses may come together out of loving concern to guard the other from sin. A wife, fearing that her husband might seek another woman if she refuses him, and wanting to keep him faithful in marriage, consents more readily to him. Or the husband may do the same, afraid that a passionate wife might otherwise look elsewhere. This union is called *gracious* or *merciful*, because it arises from love and concern for the other’s soul.

Fifth: spouses may come together from sheer, uncontrolled lust—out of mere carnal passion and delight. In this, they sin mortally.

Think of the seven husbands who married Sarah, as we read in Tobit chapters 6 and 7. One after another, they wanted to have her and went in to her for lust, and the devil strangled each of them on the first night. If only the devil would now strangle all who marry chiefly for beauty or for sensuality—very few wives would be left, and even fewer husbands! For seven men died, and one good Sarah remained.

I have lingered long on this, because I know how greatly it is needed. I had to write this out of love, even if it meant leaving aside other spiritual meanings of the Gospel for now.
