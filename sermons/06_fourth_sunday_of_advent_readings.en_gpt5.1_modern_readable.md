# Reading for the Fourth Sunday in Advent

Saint John writes in chapter 1, verses 19–26:

At that time the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to John to ask him, “Who are you?” He confessed, and did not deny what he was, and he confessed, “I am not the Christ.” And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He answered, “I am not” (not Elijah in person, as you expect). “Are you the prophet?” He answered, “No” (that is, I am not that prophet as you imagine). Then they said to him, “Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” He said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness of this world: ‘Make straight the way of the Lord by good works,’ as the prophet Isaiah says” (Isaiah 40:3). Those who had been sent were from among the scribes, who were the ones most opposed to the truth. They asked him and said to him, “Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?” John answered them, “I baptize with water—I wash with water—but there stands among you one whom you do not know, who lives among you both in his divinity and in his humanity. He is the one who comes after me, who will baptize with the Holy Spirit, the one who has been placed before me, higher in dignity as man, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to untie, if he should wear sandals.” These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

This holy reading shows us the goodness of Saint John, and it shows us the evil of the priests and scribes. In this way it teaches faithful Christians to follow John in his goodness, and not to fall into the evil of the priesthood.

John’s goodness is seen in two things: in his confession of the truth, and in his humility. He confessed the truth by saying what he was not, and by not denying what he was. He showed humility when he said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness.”

The evil of the priests, both those who sent and those who were sent, is shown in this: they hated the holy life of John, as this reading clearly shows. They say, “Why then are you baptizing?” And our Savior says in Matthew 11:18, “John came neither eating”—that is, meat—“nor drinking,” that is, wine, “and they say, ‘He has a demon’”—meaning, in himself.

Their evil shows itself again in this: they refuse to be satisfied with a good answer, but press him and attack him, saying, “Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?”

How much of this same evil the priests of today possess, who call other people who live good lives “devilish”! And when they call them heretics and in error, in that they truly hold them to be in league with the devil. Our Savior foretold this to his faithful ones in Matthew 10:25, saying, “If they have called the head of the house ‘devilish,’ how much more the members of his household!”

And just as those priests tried to stop John from baptizing, saying, “Why then are you baptizing?”, so the priests of today try to stop people from preaching, from baptizing, and from serving the mass—especially those who bring God’s truth.

They themselves do not preach the truth straight, so that people would leave their sins, and they hinder others from preaching. In the same way those earlier priests did not preach God’s law, and they hindered Christ—trying to shut his mouth, as Luke 11:53 testifies, and cursing those who believed in him, as John 9:28 shows.

So it is today. They send their messengers—from Rome and from Prague—and they hunt for bulls to shut down preaching in chapels and to burn books. This happened under the archbishop, the priest Zbyněk, and it is happening now in the confusion around the archbishopric of Prague.

Alas! They do not listen when God says in this reading, “Make straight the way of the Lord!” John made it straight: he lived well himself, he showed others the road to salvation, he rebuked sins, and by his preaching he showed how people should live. That is why he said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord!”

Here we must notice that Saint John humbly confessed his own frailty when he said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness.” That is: I am the one who is called by him who cries in the wilderness.

Understand it like this: Saint John is God’s herald, preaching in the wilderness and calling people to repentance. As we read in Luke 3:8, he calls, “Do works worthy of repentance, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”

And this call is truly God’s call. God himself is the one who calls people to repentance. God calls a person through every creature, as Saint Augustine says in *Lib. 11. Conf.*: Heaven and earth and all things that are in heaven and on earth say everywhere to me that I should love you, and they do not stop saying it to all people, so that they might not have any excuse for not having loved God.

Second, God calls out in the wilderness of this world by showing how weak and fragile every human being is. Therefore he said to Isaiah in Isaiah 40:6, “Cry!” And Isaiah said, “What shall I cry?” And God answered him, “Every person is grass, and all his glory is like the flower of the field.”

Solomon understood this when, disappointed by the emptiness of the world, he said in Ecclesiastes 12:8, “Vanity of vanities, and everything is vanity!” That means: the person who gives himself to any sort of created things and turns away from God will find nothing but vanity; for all comfort from those things will perish for him.

Therefore a person must serve God carefully, and use the things that the Lord God has given him only as far as they lead to God’s praise and to his own salvation. So he must first come to know himself: Who is he? What is he like? Where is he? And where will he be?

Who is he? He is a human being created by God and redeemed by God’s blood. What is he like? Because of sin he is miserable and weak in his works. Where is he? In a miserable world, which is a true wilderness, full of poisonous snakes—that is, priests and other evil slanderers—about whom Saint John and Christ both said that they are a brood of vipers. And where will he be? Alas, if he falls into the eternal fire!

If a person would often look into himself and truly know himself, then he could come to know God and many other things that would profit him. That is why the wise once wrote above the doors of their schools these words: “Know yourself!” For if someone wants to know wisdom, he must begin with himself. The one who does not truly know himself—how can he rightly know other things?

Saint John, knowing who he was, confessed humbly that he was “the voice of one crying in the wilderness.” And he also knew and proclaimed the dignity of the Savior when he said, “I baptize with water,” meaning: I wash with water. He showed that another would come after him who would baptize, but in a different way. “There stands among you,” John says, “as God and also as man, one whom you do not know, because of your sin and because you do not understand the prophecies. He is the one who will come after me to baptize, to preach, and to teach—just as in his human life he began after me, and after me was born. He is the one who has been placed before me—not created in his divinity, nor first created as man—but the one who, before me and before every person, is first in dignity.”

Remember this: Christ in his divinity is not made. As man he comes after Saint John, and yet in dignity he is made first above all.

John confesses this dignity when he says, “I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal.” As if to say: Is it any wonder that he is more worthy than I am? I know that he was born after me, and yet I do not fully know the mystery of his birth.

Thus says Saint Gregory in *In Om.* By the strap that fastens the shoe to the foot we are to understand the joining of Christ’s humanity with his divinity. For the Son of God took on humanity in this likeness: just as the foot exists first, and then, remaining a foot, takes on the shoe and is hidden under it, so the divinity in the person of the Son of God took on humanity and remained divinity, hidden from bodily eyes under humanity.

And John says he is not worthy to untie this strap—that is, he is not worthy to separate or explain the joining of the divinity with the humanity—as he confesses, humbly admitting his lack of understanding in this matter: “I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal.”

From this saying, the black-robed monks argue against the barefoot monks, saying that Christ walked in shoes as they do, because otherwise John would not have spoken of his sandals as he did. And the barefoot monks argue back against them that Christ walked barefoot as they do, for otherwise at the feast Mary Magdalene could not have washed his feet with her tears.

But in this quarrel neither side has a good argument. Instead, sin remains on both of them: they do not want to follow Christ the poor One, who had no desire for earthly wealth. Both sides, having too strong a desire for possessions, are unshod in their souls.

But Christ, who for their sake accepted poverty, was *shod in his mind* against any desire for earthly wealth. And if he wished, then sometimes he walked shod and sometimes barefoot.

And I do not dare to “untie” this—to decide whether he ever wore shoes or never wore them. It is enough for me that for me, a sinner, he walked upon this earth, in whatever way it pleased him.
