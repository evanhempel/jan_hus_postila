2. **God's Mercy**: The king forgives the servant's enormous debt, symbolizing God's boundless mercy toward sinners.
3. **The Servant's Failure**: The forgiven servant refuses to show mercy to a fellow servant who owed him a small amount, demonstrating hypocrisy.
4. **Consequences of Unforgiveness**: The unforgiving servant is punished, representing the severe consequences of failing to forgive others.
5. **Application to Life**: Hus urges listeners to forgive others sincerely, as God will judge them according to their willingness to forgive.
6. **Warning to the Unmerciful**: Those who refuse to forgive will face eternal punishment, just as the unforgiving servant did.
