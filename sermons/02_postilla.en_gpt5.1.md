### POSTILLA.

An exposition of the holy Sunday readings. The merciful Savior, the almighty Lord, the Son of God, Jesus Christ, true God and true man, came into the world to bear witness to the truth, to preach about the kingdom of heaven, to seek out the lost sheep, and to show them by word and deed the path to eternal joy, in this fully accomplishing the will of his Father, the Lord God. The gracious Savior, in humility and quietness and in poverty, being rejected by proud people and by the clever of this world, and especially by bishops, by masters, by priests and by lawyers, who always opposed him, labored among the people in preaching right up to death; and he did this out of great compassion. Therefore Saint Matthew writes in chapter 9, verses 36–38, saying: When Jesus saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were troubled and lay there like sheep that have no shepherd. Then he said to his disciples: Truly, the harvest is great, but the workers are few; therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers into his harvest. That is: there are many people who would gladly hear the word of God and would, like wheat, be fit to be brought into the barn of Christ’s kingdom; but the workers are not many, that is, there are few faithful preachers who, out of love for the praise of God, for the salvation of others and of themselves, labor among God’s people. Therefore the Savior says: Ask the Lord of the harvest, that is, God, who is Lord of the whole world, to send faithful reapers into his harvest. Saint Gregory weighs this word, “The harvest is great and the workers are few,” saying, In. om.: We cannot speak of this without heavy sorrow, for though there are those who would gladly hear good things, there are not those who would proclaim them. See, the world is filled with priests, and yet in God’s harvest a truly diligent worker is very rarely found; for we accept the priestly office, but we do not fulfill the works of the office. But consider, my brothers, consider what the Lord says: Ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers into his harvest! You pray for us, that we may be able to prepare useful things for you, that the tongue may not cease from admonishing; and since we have taken the place of preaching, may it not be that our silence should condemn us before the righteous Judge. This is Saint Gregory.

Taking his words, but first of all those of my Savior, to heart, so that I would by no means abandon the priestly office or waste time, I have resolved, for the praise of God and for the salvation of faithful Czechs who desire to know and to do the will of God, to explain briefly, with God’s help, all the Sunday readings; asking that those who will read or hear them may be saved, may first beware of sins, love God above all things, keep grace among themselves, make progress in virtues, and pray to the Lord God on behalf of me, a sinner.

And since, in general, they do not have the readings written in Czech, and an explanation is not so easily accepted without a foundation, I want always first to set down the reading and then the exposition, so that the word of our Savior may always sound forth most of all, and thus be made known to the faithful for salvation; for those who, being in grace, hear it until death will be saved and are blessed even here, as the Savior himself says in Luke 11:28: Blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it. Keeping this in mind, we ought diligently, gladly, bravely, and joyfully to listen to the words of our gracious Savior, to tell and preach them to others, carefully to bring them to understanding, and, according to one passage of Scripture, to explain another, as the saints, by God’s gift, explain them. And I intend, as far as I can, to explain the readings in the easiest way for understanding, though not altogether in the same manner as when I preach.

First Sunday in Advent.
