title: Fifth Sunday After Holy Trinity
---

This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon on the Fifth Sunday after Holy Trinity, based on Luke chapter 5, verses 1-11. The sermon emphasizes the importance of hearing and teaching God's Word, the symbolism of Jesus' actions by the lake, and the spiritual lessons drawn from Peter's encounter with Jesus.

**Introduction**: Jan Hus reflects on the crowds flocking to hear Jesus teach by the Sea of Galilee, highlighting Jesus' role as a preacher who practiced what he preached and welcomed sinners.

**Key Points**:
1. Jesus' teaching by the lake symbolizes the freedom and importance of preaching God's Word anywhere, even in humble settings.
2. The two boats represent the Jewish and Gentile peoples, and Jesus entering Peter's boat signifies His incarnation among the Jews.
3. The miraculous catch of fish symbolizes the gathering of believers, though some may fall away.
4. Peter's humility and recognition of his sinfulness serve as a model for all Christians to acknowledge their unworthiness before God.
5. Hus criticizes ecclesiastical authorities for restricting the preaching of God's Word, affirming the need to follow Jesus' example of freely teaching the Gospel.
6. The sermon emphasizes the importance of humility, obedience, and reliance on God's Word in fishing for souls.
7. Hus identifies three types of "nets": Christ's nets of virtue, the devil's nets of sin, and worldly nets of human traditions.

**Key Quote**:

> "Vyjdi ote mne, pane, nebt člověk hřiešný jsem." (Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.)
