# Reading for the Second Sunday in Advent

Saint Luke writes in chapter 21, verses 25–33:  

“At that time Jesus said: There will be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress among the nations because of the roaring and surging of the sea. People will wither away from fear and from expecting what is coming upon the whole world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great power and glory. And when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.  

And He told them a parable: Look at the fig tree and all the trees. When they already put out their fruit, you know that summer is near. So also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near. Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.”

Last Sunday we remembered Christ’s coming in humility and gentleness. Today this reading shows us His coming in power and glory.

Then it was said that the King came to us gentle and poor, riding on a donkey. But today the reading says they “will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great power and glory.” This is so that those who refuse to love the gentle and humble Christ will at least learn to fear the mighty and glorious Christ.

The memory of His first coming should lift up our hope; the memory of His second coming should keep us in holy fear. Christians must have both hope and fear. Fear holds them back so they do not plunge into sin; hope holds them up so that troubles do not crush them.

For Solomon says in Proverbs 1:32: “The turning away of the simple will kill them, and the ease and success of fools will destroy them.”

In today’s reading, both fear and hope are set before us. Fear and dread run from the beginning of the reading down to the words, “And when these things begin to happen.” Then hope begins where it says, “Lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”

Our Savior lays down for us both terror and hope. He shows the signs that will happen before His coming at the Last Judgment, which will take place when He says: “There will be signs in the sun and in the moon.”

Second, He sets out His own coming when He says, “Then they will see the Son of Man.”  

Third, He promises comfort to the righteous when He says, “Lift up your heads.”  

Fourth, He gives a warning to turn us away from evil.

This whole reading is given so that we would carefully fix our eyes on the final coming, the visitation of Christ.

When the disciples asked Christ the Savior about the Day of Judgment—this was after Palm Sunday, on the Mount of Olives—they said, Matthew 24:3: “Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world?” Among other words He answered them like this: “There will be signs in the sun and in the moon,” and so on.

Our Savior points to signs in heavenly things—the sun, the moon, the stars—and also in earthly things—on the earth, on the sea, and among people, who will dry up and waste away with fear and dread.

He says: “There will be signs in the sun, and in the moon and in the stars.” And what signs? In the reading from Saint Matthew, chapter 24, verse 29, He says: “The sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven.”

The sun already had such a sign when it was darkened at Christ’s death (Matthew 27:45). In that time the moon also lost its light, and the stars as well, which receive their light from the sun.

But this can also be understood in another way: that the sun, meaning Christ, will be darkened before the Day of Judgment, so that people will no longer see that sun with living faith. And the moon, meaning the assembly of Christians, will not give its light—that is, it will no longer shine with true teaching and good works. And the stars, that is, people, will fall from heaven, meaning they will fall away from a heavenly way of life.

For the dragon Antichrist, as Saint John bears witness in the Revelation, *Apok.* 12:4, “with his tail drew a third part of the stars from heaven.” Not the stars that shine in the sky, for those will neither fall nor be pulled down by the dragon, but will remain there forever. It means that people will fall away from heavenly things through the terror and cunning of Antichrist and the deception of his messengers.

Christ Himself foretold this when He first said to His disciples, Matthew 24:4–5, 24: “Watch out that no one deceives you. For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray. And false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so that, if it were possible, even the chosen would be led into error.”

This is being fulfilled very strongly in our day. Christ’s truth and Christ Himself scarcely shine in people anymore. Many no longer want the Scriptures to be read or preached, and they do not want Christ even to be named. And whoever they catch boldly confessing Christ’s truth, they curse, slander, banish, behead, torture, imprison, and kill.

In Moravia, for example, an *oficiál* and others starved a faithful man to death, and they let the feet of a preacher, priest Martin, rot away. And what happened last year in Prague, and what is even now being done to those who hold to Christ’s truth, is known to many.

All this comes from the messengers of Antichrist, from false preachers who chase after money from the people for their own greed, pride, pleasure, and immorality. They sell the forgiveness of sins for money, saying that the pope is an earthly god who has power to give forgiveness of sins to whomever he wishes, whenever he wishes. But they do not tell the people that Christ says, Luke 13:3: “If you do not repent of your sins, you will all likewise perish.”

They have so greatly darkened the truth—Christ Himself—that preachers now name the pope more often than Christ, and praise and keep the pope’s decrees more than the law of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Therefore great trouble has come upon His faithful children in many lands. In Bohemia, in Moravia, in Meissen, in England, and elsewhere there is great persecution—I know this from testimony. They murder, torture, and curse faithful priests. And there is no point in sending appeals to Rome, for there is the very peak of all Antichrist’s wickedness: pride, greed, immorality, hypocrisy, and simony. From Rome all the way to Bohemia, simony and greed have poured out.

They sell and buy archbishoprics more dearly than some lordships in Bohemia. They lease out indulgences, so that each messenger of Antichrist may squeeze as much as he can from simple people. That is why people are “withering up”: some because they fear to confess the truth against that error; others because, seeing the division among the clergy in their preaching, they do not know what to hold to; others because they are heavy-hearted that so many wander in error; and still others because they endure shame, being called heretics and being killed, and suffer from the great persecution raised against God’s truth.

“The sea is roaring.” The sea here means the people of this world, who are compared to the sea. I say “roaring” because they cry out that those who follow Christ and hold His truth are straying and heretical.

David says in Psalm 93:4 that “the uprisings of the sea are wondrous”—meaning, it is a strange thing how people have risen up against Christ and against the truth, and have lifted up their voice. For he also says, Psalm 93:3: “The floods have lifted up their voice.”

So now there are signs in the sun—that is, in Christ, that because of the increase of sins people no longer see Him with living faith. There are signs in the moon—that is, in those who should, having received the light of Scripture from Christ, shine for others; now they do not shine. And there are signs in the stars—those who ought to cling with desire to heavenly things have bent their desires toward earthly ways, especially those who ought to shine for others, such as masters and prelates, those set above others in spiritual office.

Such learned men, if they live badly and lead others into worse living, fall away from the eternal light. But those who live well and teach many to righteousness will shine forever. As the prophet Daniel says, Daniel 12:3: “Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the sky, and those who turn many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever and ever.”

There you have it: clearly the prophet calls good, learned people who teach others “stars.” And they have their light from the sun Christ, who is the Sun of Righteousness, as Malachi says, Malachi 4:2: “For you who fear my name, the Sun of Righteousness will rise.”

But for false priests and preachers that sun has set behind the mountain, as the prophet Micah says, Micah 3:6: “The sun will set on the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.” Just before that he says, Micah 3:5: “Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who lead my people astray, who bite with their teeth and cry, ‘Peace,’ but if someone does not put something in their mouths, they declare holy war against him.”

Perhaps this Scripture touches those who, against people who refuse to be subject to them in all things, proclaim a crusade and call it a holy war, and a holy battle, promising forgiveness of sins and release from punishment to those who help in that war.

What a strange thing! They cannot free themselves from fleas and flies, and yet they claim they can free others from the torments of hell by their grants of pardon—even without praying for them or living good lives!

And if there is some faithful Christian who preaches against their evil, they hate him. By clever wickedness they block the services of God, since they cannot stop the preaching in any other way, preaching that exposes their evil to the people.

With this cunning, Antichrist uses his greatest skill in fighting against the freedom and honor of our Lord Jesus Christ. About this cunning I have written fully in other books, both in Czech and in Latin.

It seems to me that this particular cunning is the hardest and heaviest burden for faithful Christians. For neither reproach, nor torture, nor even death can stop the preaching of truth from a faithful preacher of Christ who truly loves God. But the cleverly invented shutting down of divine service is a great hindrance—not only to the one who wants to preach, but also to the people who long to hear.

What can weigh more heavily on Christians than to be denied burial, baptism, confession, and the body of Christ? Among these, the hardest would be if they refused to baptize. But faithful and wise Christians would overthrow even that.

Priests would refuse to obey such a command. Other people would not care where their bodies were buried. And parents, in great need, would baptize their children themselves. In this way, with God’s help, they would tear apart Antichrist’s nets, by which he cunningly deceives people under the name of holy obedience.

This is that great tribulation of which the Savior says, Matthew 24:21–22: “There will be then a great tribulation such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall be. And if those days had not been shortened, no person would be saved; but for the sake of God’s chosen the days will be shortened.”

The course of our present time gives faithful Christians understanding of this holy reading about the signs of Judgment Day, so that, seeing how things run, they would weigh the words of their Savior and, understanding them, prepare themselves carefully against the cunning of Antichrist. For after these signs, the coming of the Son of God will not be delayed.

About Him the reading continues: “The powers of the heavens will be shaken.” That is, the angels, as Saint Gregory says, will be moved to the judgment with the Son of Man against sinners. For Scripture says, *Sap.* 5:18: “He will arm the creation for vengeance against His enemies.”

Therefore it goes on: “Then they will see the Son of Man”—that is, Jesus Christ, who is the Son not of two human parents, but of one human, the Virgin Mary—“coming,” that is, coming to judge, “in a cloud” (what sort of cloud that will be, He knows!), “with great power,” meaning with great power against proud sinners. For the prophet David says, Psalm 97:3: “Fire goes before Him and burns up all His enemies around Him.”

“And with glory,” meaning to comfort the righteous. For He immediately gives comfort to His own when He says: “And when these things begin to happen, look up”—that is, turn your pure hearts toward my help—“and lift up your heads,” meaning your minds. As Saint Gregory says: To lift up our heads is to lift our minds in joy toward our heavenly Father.

For the Savior continues: “Because your redemption is drawing near.” As if He were saying: Now your deliverance is about to come, and the eternal condemnation of the wicked as well.

Then the reading says: “And He spoke to them a parable: Look at the fig tree and all the trees,” and so on. Here the Savior gives His people a picture and a sign. Just as when the fruit on the trees ripens, you know that summer is near, so when plagues, famines, wars, earthquakes, and the signs already mentioned are in the world, then for the faithful the kingdom of God is near—that is, the blessedness they will have in heaven.

Therefore the Savior adds: “So also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.”

And He confirms this with an oath: “Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened.” That is, the human race will not pass from death into immortality until all these things, already named, are fulfilled.

He proves it further: “Heaven and earth will pass away,” meaning the heavens will be changed and become more beautiful after Judgment Day, and the earth will also be changed. “But my words will not pass away,” meaning they will not be changed, but what I have meant by these words will always come to pass.

That, briefly, is on the reading.

Because the merciful Savior often spoke about His final coming, His last visitation, warning His faithful and telling how terrible it will be, we must carefully remember this coming, take it very seriously, and live good lives.

For the Lord will come, and to the wicked He will be very terrifying, so that the damned will say to the mountains, Hosea 10:8 and Luke 23:30: “Fall on us!” He will come, and no damned person will be heard. He will come and reveal every evil deed of every person to all the angels, all people, and all demons. He will come and with eternal fire burn all the damned. He will come and sentence them to eternal fire and darkness and every kind of evil misery.

Therefore Saint Gregory says in today’s sermon: “That day, dearest brothers, set before your eyes. And whatever seems hard to you now will become light.” For about that day the prophet Joel says, Joel 2:31: “The day of the Lord is near, great and very terrible; and who can endure it?”

And the prophet Zephaniah, *Sofonias* 2, says: “The great day of the Lord is near, near and coming quickly. The sound of the day of the Lord is bitter; the mighty man there will cry out. That day is a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish, a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and storm, a day of trumpet and war cry.”

So writes Zephaniah, showing that the Day of Judgment will be very terrible for the wicked.

About it Saint Peter writes this way, 2 Peter 3:10–12: “The day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a great rushing sound, and the elements will be dissolved with burning heat, and the earth and all the works that are on it will be burned up. Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what kind of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of our Lord Jesus Christ, because of which the heavens, being on fire, will be dissolved, and the elements will melt with the heat of fire?”

So writes the chief apostle about the Day of Judgment. On that day, above us will stand as Judge the One whom the wicked have offended and who is angry with them. Beneath us, horrible hell will stand open. On the right hand, all sins will openly accuse. On the left, demons will be dragging people down into hell. Around us and behind us, the world will be burning. Before us, the angels will be driving the condemned into hell. Within, conscience will be biting cruelly. Without, the eternal fire will be burning the body. And all the saints will be confirming the sentence and saying with the Judge: “Go away from us, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire!”

O dearest friends, when we weigh such a heavy and terrible coming of Christ and such a Judgment Day, let us carefully remember Christ’s first coming: that He took flesh and came into the world in hardship for our salvation.

Let us be grateful, so that He may now visit us inwardly by His grace and at our death may find us ready.

Let us remember His final, fearful coming, so that we may be sentenced to heavenly joy. For Saint Gregory says in today’s sermon: “That day, dearest brothers, remember with all your mind. Correct your life. Change your habits. Overcome evil temptations. Avenge the sins you have committed with tears. For you will see the coming of the eternal Judge all the more safely, the more you now prepare yourselves in fear of His terrors.”

May the merciful Savior, true God and true man, blessed forever—Jesus Christ—bring all this about for our salvation.
