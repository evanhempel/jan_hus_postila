title: Second Reading For Church Consecration
---

This is a summary of Jan Hus's sermon on church consecration, based on John 10:22. Hus critiques the misuse of consecration feasts for gluttony and sin, while emphasizing the spiritual purpose of dedicating churches to God's worship and truth.  

Key points:  
- **Church consecration** commemorates the dedication of a building to God’s glory, preaching, prayer, and sacraments (1 Kings 8).  
- **Three biblical consecrations** of Solomon’s temple (by Solomon, Zerubbabel, and Judas Maccabeus) symbolize Christ’s threefold sanctification of His Church:  
  1. On the cross (sacrifice).  
  2. Through repentance (purification).  
  3. At the resurrection (eternal perfection).  
- **Three defilements** of the temple (by idolatry, greed, and pride) warn against corrupting the Church with sin.  
- **Spiritual temple**: Believers are God’s true temple (1 Corinthians 3:16), built on Christ through faith, hope, and love.  
- **Virtues as building blocks**:  
  - *Faith* is the foundation.  
  - *Hope* forms four walls (election, eternal joy, deliverance from hell, and communion with Christ).  
  - *Love* is the roof, covering all.  
- **Seven gifts of the Spirit** (Isaiah 11:2-3) counteract the seven deadly sins and lead to the Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3-9).
