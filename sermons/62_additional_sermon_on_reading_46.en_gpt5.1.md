SUPPLEMENT. Another sermon on the reading 46, about which mention is made on page 367 of this Postil. (According to the Postil printed in Nuremberg in the year 1563.)

One man asked me, I trust God from a good desire, that I would write something on that word, Luke 10:30: “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who stripped him, and after laying wounds upon him, went away, leaving him half dead.” The merciful Savior spoke these words, lifting up his eyes, wanting to teach that master who had asked him, What, doing it, should I obtain the kingdom of heaven? and to teach us also, who must do the same thing, as the merciful Savior showed that master. That is this: that we must love the Lord our God with all our heart, and with all our mind, and with all our strength, and our neighbor as ourselves. And because it would take long to write about that love, and because I have already written of it in my books On the Commandment of God, in chapter 31, therefore I will now leave that, and will weigh this instead: “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who stripped him and, after putting wounds on him, went away, leaving him half dead.” Whether this really happened to some man in fact between Jerusalem and Jericho, those two cities in which now the pagans live, that I do not know for certain; but in the spiritual sense, surely it has so happened. And because the gracious Savior wanted this to be weighed by us, therefore, as St. Luke says (Luke 10:30), he lifted up his eyes and said: “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who stripped him, and after laying wounds upon him, went away, leaving him half dead.” The merciful Jesus weighed the misery of man into which he had fallen by sin: having gone away from Jerusalem, that is, from “the vision of peace,” to Jericho, that is, to the instability of the world, in which he has been stripped, wounded, and gone off half-alive. The Lord Jesus weighed this; let us also weigh it. What? The departure, the fall, the stripping, the wounding, and the half‑killing. For the Lord Jesus, looking up carefully, said: “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who stripped him, and after laying wounds on him, went away, leaving him half dead.”

Let us weigh the departure. How? In this way: Who went away? That a certain man. From where? From Jerusalem. Where to? To Jericho. What befell him? That he fell among robbers, was stripped, wounded, and went off half‑alive. A certain man. Which man? Adam with all his sinful offspring. He went away by disobedience from Jerusalem, that is, from the vision of peace and from blessedness. Where did he descend? To Jericho, that is, into the instability of this world. How did he go away? Hear that the Savior says he was going down. How? In this way: The Lord God created Adam and Eve, he gave them the commandment that they should not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, saying (Genesis 2:16–17): Of every tree in the garden you may eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat. Surely, whatever hour you eat of it, you will surely die. Behold, Adam and Eve heard this commandment, they heard the prohibition, they heard also the punishment, if they did not restrain themselves. What happened? Eve saw the tree, pleasant to the eyes and delightful for food; seeing it, she desired it. The crafty devil saw this, and, taking the form of a serpent—of which Eve was not at all afraid, for she had no sin—he crawled up to her, found her alone, and said to her: Why has God forbidden you to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? Eve said: So that we might not perhaps die. The serpent said to her: You will certainly not die, but you will be like gods, knowing evil and good, that is, the bad and the good. Eve obeyed the serpent, took, ate, and gave to her husband, and he ate. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they made themselves girdles of fig leaves (Genesis 3:1–7). O, whom did that serpent strip to nakedness? Man. Whom did he wound? Man. Whom did he leave and depart from? Man. Fully alive? Not at all. How then? Half‑alive. And what, did Adam die? And what you had, when God said it so that it should not happen, did that not come to pass? Surely it came to pass: Adam and Eve died in soul, though they remained alive in body, and so they were half‑alive.

Hear the fall from blessedness into instability and into wounding; mark the going down of man, for the Savior says: “A certain man was going down.” How was he going down? In this way: Eve went astray in God’s commandment, she obeyed the devil, she saw the fruit, she desired it, she consented, she ate, and so she transgressed God’s commandment. She was going down: she began to go down when she transgressed by accepting the suggestion; she went further down when she took delight both in the fruit and in the serpent’s words; and she completed the step of going down when she finally consented, did not believe God when he had said to her (Genesis 2:17): On the very day you eat of it, you will surely die. She, however, had said (Genesis 3:3): So that we might not perhaps die. And the crafty serpent, hearing this, pressed her, saying (Genesis 3:4–5): You will certainly not die; for God knows that on the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like gods, knowing evil and good. Behold, now you hear how a certain man was going down: by suggestion, by delight, by going astray in God’s word, by consent, and by completing the deed; that Eve accepted the serpent’s prompting, went astray in the word of God, consented to the serpent’s counsel, and wanted to know, as God knows. She took the fruit, ate, and gave it to Adam, and thus together they completed the going down from Jerusalem to Jericho for their sinful offspring. And so that one man who was going down signifies the whole race of Adam, which walks that same road of sin as Adam did.

Seeing this, the Lord Jesus Christ said: “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers, who stripped him, and after laying wounds on him, went away, leaving him half dead.” O foolish man! You believed the serpent more than the Lord God! What were you lacking? Were you hungry, perhaps? What did you mean to become, a god? The angel, that serpent, reached in heaven after the might of God, wanting to be equal with him; and you reached after his wisdom, after his counsel, wanting to be wise like God. Therefore this is what you have gained: that one, being made a devil, is damned forever, driven out of heaven; and you, O man, enslaving your offspring, have been driven out of Paradise! O man! You have descended from height into lowliness, into guilt from innocence, from light into darkness, from fullness into hunger, from health into sickness, and from life into death; and if there had been no Samaritan, you would have died and would have been damned forever like the devil. Therefore Jesus, lifting up his eyes and seeing this your descent, says: “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers, who stripped him, and after putting wounds on him, went away, leaving him half dead.”

O man! notice that going down is evil; the fall is worse; but worst of all is the stripping, the wounding, and the half‑dying: evil is the going down from God’s grace into his wrath, from the image of God into a beastlike and devilish likeness; the fall is worse, that beyond this you have fallen from peace into unrest, from among the angels into the midst of robbers, the devils; but the worst is the stripping, the wounding, and the dying: the stripping away of innocence, the wounding in all powers, and the dying in the soul. This is surely a terrible calamity! Jesus lifted up his eyes and saw; seeing, he weighed the heaviness of the going down, of the fall, of the wounding, of the stripping, and of the dying; and thus, weighing the greatness of the fall, he was troubled in spirit and fainted to the point of bloody sweat. Why? Because he was to repair that going down, that fall, that stripping, that wounding, and that dying by a heavy death. How? In this way: Presumptuously, evilly, and foolishly man, wanting to be God, exalted himself wrongly; the Son of God wanted wisely and rightly to be man, and so he humbled himself. Why? Because there was no way more fitting for man to be lifted up from the fall, from the stripping, from the wounding, and from the dying, and restored to his first state. Therefore, because man exalted himself, God humbled himself; that one wrongly, and this one rightly; that one by sin, and this one by grace. Man wanted, like God, to know everything presumptuously; God, on the other hand, wanted to be like a little child, unknowing in name. Man wanted to rob God of wisdom; again, the Son of God, being without robbery equal to God the Father, wanted to be a suffering servant. Man has been robbed by the devils; the Son of God has been robbed for him by the soldiers and by the Jews. The devil overcame man on a tree; again, the Son of God overcame the devil on a tree. Eve looked at the tree cheerfully and sweetly (Genesis 3:6); Mary stood by the cross sorrowfully and painfully (John 19:25). Adam took from the tree sweet fruit, ate it (Genesis 3:6), and slew himself and his offspring; Christ on the tree drank vinegar and gall with myrrh, and, dying in the body (John 19:30), he made his sons alive in soul. And so what man lost, the Son of God has restored: having lost grace, he has been brought back to grace; having been stripped and wounded, he has been restored from full health.

For God had given health to man in Paradise, such that there was nothing, either in him inwardly or from outside, that could harm him: no pain would have pierced him, no toil wearied him, no shame disgraced him, no cold hurt him, no terror frightened him, no illness enfeebled him, no anxiety made his limbs weak. There was in man life without dying; there was in him no opposition between the law of the flesh and the law of the will, but full rest. In him there was memory without forgetting, understanding without wandering; he was very free in his will, for he had the power not to sin. Such health man had before the fall. And when he went down, he was stripped of God’s grace and of virtue, and he was wounded, so that pain pierces him, toil troubles him, shame disgraces him, heat burns him, cold shakes him, fear assaults him, strength withers, illnesses grow, and in the end the physicians cannot help. The flesh resists the soul; it is hard to learn; memory fails; understanding goes astray; and worst of all, man cannot here be without daily sin. And so he is wounded to such a degree that Isaiah says (Isaiah 1:6) that from the sole of the foot to the top of the head, bodily or spiritual. From the sole, that is, from the lowest thought, up to the top of the head, that is, up to the highest understanding of the mind, in which there is much obscuring from foolishness and other hindrances. And is not that a great wounding of body and soul? Are there few wounds there? Are there few pains up to half‑death? No, rather the whole man has died, first in soul and then in body. This is indeed a heavy fall; there cannot be a heavier than into the eternal fire of hell; nor a heavier stripping, than the deprivation of all joy; nor a greater wounding, than only eternal torment in hell.

Jesus lifted up his eyes and has shown us thus man who has fallen, been stripped, wounded, and dead, saying: “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers, who stripped him, and, wounding him, went away leaving him half dead.” Who could help such a wretch? A priest? or a prophet? Surely none but the Son of God. Why? Because they had gone down by the same road. Therefore the Savior says: “And it happened that a certain priest was going down that same road, and when he saw him he passed by. Likewise a Levite, when he came by the place, and saw him, passed by” (Luke 10:31–32). That priest signifies all priests, and that Levite^1 all the prophets, who, being themselves likewise stripped, wounded, and killed, could not help man. But who could? The Lord Jesus shows us, saying: “But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to him, and when he saw him, he was moved with mercy, and drew near, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine, and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him” (Luke 10:33–34). And who is that merciful Samaritan, who would be willing and so mighty that he could heal one so fallen, stripped, wounded, and sick, even dead? Surely the Son of God, Christ, is that Samaritan. For Samaritan is said to mean “guardian;” and who is a better guardian than Christ, who in his Godhead never sleeps, neither by night nor by day, without whose guarding no one guards anything? As David says (Psalm 127:1): Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman keeps awake in vain. That Samaritan, “as he journeyed,” or going by the road, that is, having been made man for us, went by the side of the wounded man, in that he took upon himself, apart from sin, our suffering, hunger, thirst, heat and cold, sorrow, pains, and death. As St. Paul says (Hebrews 2:17), that he had to be made like his brothers in all things, although he did not have to take sin upon himself so that he should sin. This one, being moved with mercy, came near, so near that he could not be nearer; for, being God, he did not want to become an angelic person, as St. Paul says (Hebrews 2:16), but, being God, he wanted to become man, so that, being poor, needy, suffering, and mortal, he might be a merciful and faithful high priest before God, to have compassion on the sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered and has been tempted, he is able to help those who suffer temptation. Behold, thus he has come near to the wounded man; he has bound up the wounds so firmly to his first health that all powers, both of soul and of body, can be restored, so that man in blessedness will be as healthy as he was in Paradise. For so well has he bound them, pouring on oil and wine: the oil of mercy, and the wine of the rejoicing of the heart. And he set him on his beast, that is, he took suffering for him upon his own body, as he says through David (Psalm 73:22): I have been made as a beast. He led him into the inn, that is, into the assembly of the holy people, in which lie the sick and those who repent of their sins; and he took great care of him, for more than thirty‑two years he remained in suffering for him. “And on the next day” (Luke 10:35), that is, in the now gracious time, “he took out two denarii,” that is, he made known the Old and the New Testament, “and gave them to the innkeeper,” that is, to the priest, who is to pitch the dung of sins out. O innkeepers, dung‑shovelers! God grant that you would first pitch out of yourselves the pus of stinking sins! “And he said: Take care of him,” that is, so that you may heal him, not that you may flay him, strip him, wound him more, and kill him; “and whatever more you spend,” that is, whatever labor, help, and strength you lay out, “I, when I return,” that is, on the Day of Judgment, “will repay you.”

Behold, we now hear from our glorious Savior his teaching; we hear our stripping, wounding, fall, and death. And let us also hear the great mercy of the Savior, that he who is God was willing so to humble himself into manhood, to restore upon the cross what Adam lost at the tree in Paradise. Lightly and quickly was sin committed; long was it waited for, and heavily was the lost thing brought back. Adam and Eve suffered for a long time, repenting much here in this world; several thousand years they remained after death in the dark prison. We blame Adam or Eve, and we sin more, though we already have warning from them. Eve charged her sin to the serpent when she excused herself before God; Adam to Eve. She saying (Genesis 3:13): The serpent deceived me! Adam (Genesis 3:12): The woman whom you gave me, she gave me, and I ate. But we lay blame on the serpent, on Eve, on Adam, and thus we push the guilt onto God, when, being guilty of sin, we excuse ourselves. Therefore, knowing that to excuse oneself in this way is a grievous sin, let us leave both sins and excuses, and let us love God above all other things, and our neighbor, the man Jesus Christ, our most dearly beloved brother, who then says further: “Which of these three seems to you to have been neighbor to him who fell among robbers? And he said: The one who showed mercy to him. And Jesus said to him: Go, and you, do likewise” (Luke 10:36–37).

What is this: Go, and you, do likewise? It is nothing else than: be merciful to your neighbor as I am merciful; do not accept persons, as I do not accept persons; suffer for the salvation of your neighbor, as I have suffered; weigh my suffering, for I have weighed your stripping and wounding. Behold, from the good question of the Jewish master the Lord Jesus has given us such good teaching, that we might recognize our own lack, highly value his benefaction, and thus love him with all our heart, be merciful to our neighbor, and so, by God’s help and by the merit of our gracious Lord Christ, attain eternal life. Amen.
