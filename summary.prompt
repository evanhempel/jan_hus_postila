0. **Markdown Metadata**
1. **1-3 sentence introduction** in paragraph form, make clear this is a summary not the full text. 
2. **Bullet points** with key content:
   - Use `-` or `1.` for bullets
     - Nest bullets as needed
     - use numbered bullets Jan Hus numbers his points
   - Keep each point concise (1-2 sentences max)
3. **Key quote**: At the end, add a key quote from the sermon as a markdown block quote.

Rules:

2. When refering to the speaker use his full name "Jan Hus"
3. Always use full book names (no abbreviations) and use 1 or 2 instead of First or Second.
4. copy the markdown metadata at the top of the Postila but update the `lang:` to `en` and `version_name:` to `An English Summary`

Keep the summary length appropriate to fit on a single screen.
