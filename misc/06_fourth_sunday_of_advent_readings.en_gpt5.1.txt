### READING FOR THE FOURTH SUNDAY IN ADVENT

Saint John writes in chapter 1, verses 19–26. At that time the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to John to ask him, saying: “Who are you?” And he confessed (that he was not the Christ) and did not deny (what he truly was), but confessed: “I am not the Christ.” And they asked him: “What then are you? Are you Elijah?” And he answered: “I am not” (that Elijah in person, as you expect). “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered: “No” (that is, I am not that prophet, as you suppose). Then they said to him: “Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?” He said: “I am the voice of one crying for Christ in the wilderness of this world: Make straight, by good deeds, the way of the Lord God, as Isaiah the prophet says” (in chapter 40, verse 3). And those who had been sent were from among the scribes (who above all set themselves against the truth); and they questioned him and said to him: “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” John answered them, saying: “I baptize in water (that is, I wash with water), but among you there has stood one (dwelling among you both according to his divinity and according to his humanity) whom you do not know (that he is God and the Christ). He it is who comes after me (to baptize with the Holy Spirit), who has been made before me (more worthy than I in his humanity), the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie (if he should have a sandal).” These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

This holy reading shows both the goodness of Saint John and the wickedness of the priests, and so it teaches faithful Christians to follow Saint John in his goodness, and not to fall into priestly wickedness. John’s goodness is shown in his confession of the truth and in his humility: he confessed the truth by saying what he was not, and not denying what he was; he showed humility when he said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness.” The priestly malice of those who sent, and who were sent, is shown in that the life of Saint John was hateful to them, as the reading bears witness; for they say: “Why then do you baptize?” And our Savior says in chapter 11, verse 18 of S. Mat.: “John came, neither eating (that is, flesh) nor drinking” (that is, wine), “and they say: He has a demon!” that is, within himself.

Their malice is shown in a second way, in that they do not want to be satisfied with a good answer, but press him further, saying: “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” O, how much of that same malice today’s priests have, who call others who live well “devil-possessed”! For when they call them heretics and in error, then in that they judge them to be demon-possessed. And this our Savior prophesied of his faithful ones in chapter 10, verse 25 of S. Mat., saying: “Since they have called the master of the house demon-possessed, how much more those of his household.” And just as they tried to hinder John from baptizing, saying, “Why then do you baptize?”, so now the priests of our time try to forbid others to preach and to baptize and to celebrate Mass, if those others bear God’s truth. They themselves do not straightforwardly preach the truth so that people would leave their sins, and they hinder others; just as those priests did not preach God’s law, and they hindered Christ, stopping up his mouth, as St Luke testifies (11:53), and cursing those who believed in him, as St John bears witness (9:28).

So too do the priests of today, sending their messengers both from Rome and from Prague, and seeking bulls so that preaching may be stopped in chapels and books may be burned; as happened in the days of Archbishop Zbyněk the priest, and as is now happening in the confusions of the archbishopric of Prague. Alas! they will not listen when God says in this very reading, “Make straight the way of the Lord!” John made it straight: he himself lived well, he showed others the road to salvation, he rebuked sins, and by his preaching showed how they ought to live; therefore he also said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness: make straight the way of the Lord!”

Here we must notice that Saint John humbly confessed his own frailty when he said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,” that is: I am the one called by him who cries in the wilderness. And so understand that Saint John is God’s herald, preaching in the wilderness and calling the people to repentance, saying, as in St Luke chapter 3, verse 8: “Do works worthy of repentance, for the kingdom of heaven is drawing near.” And this calling is done by God, who calls to repentance; God calls a person through every creature, as St Augustine says in Lib. 11. Conf.: “Heaven and earth and all things that are in heaven and in earth, behold, everywhere say to me that I should love you, and they do not cease saying this to all men, so that they may have no excuse that they did not love God.”

Secondly, God cries out in the wilderness of this world that every human being is very frail; therefore he said to Isaiah in chapter 40, verse 6: “Cry out!” And Isaiah said: “What shall I cry?” And God said to him: “Every person is grass, and all his glory is like the flower of the field!” This Solomon understood when, deceived by the vanity of the world, he says in Eccl. ult., 12, 8: “Vanity of vanities, and all things vanity!”—that is: a person who gives himself over to any created thing whatsoever, after leaving God, finds nothing but vanity; for the delight of all things will perish for him. Therefore a person has need to serve God diligently, and to use the things that the Lord God has given him for nothing more than God’s praise and his own salvation; and so he should first come to know himself: who he is, what he is like, where he is, and where he will be. Who is he? A person created by God and redeemed by his blood. What is he like? Because of sins he is wretched and weak in his deeds. Where is he? In a wretched world, which is a true wilderness, full of poisonous snakes, that is, priests and other evil slanderers, of whom Saint John and Christ said that they are a brood of vipers. And where will he be? Alas for him if he falls into the everlasting fire!

If a person would often look into himself and know himself, then he could know God as well, and many other things to his profit. Therefore the wise once wrote this saying over the door of their school: “Know yourself!”—so that whoever wants to know wisdom may begin first with himself; for whoever does not truly know himself, how can he know other things? Saint John, having known himself, what he was, humbly confessed that he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness; and he knew and declared the dignity of the Savior, saying: “I baptize in water,” showing that he who is coming after me will baptize; yet even now, as God and as man, he is among you, whom you, because of your sin and for not understanding the prophecies, do not know. He it is who after me will go before me in baptizing, preaching and teaching; just as after me he began, in his human life, and after me he was born; he, who has been made before me—not in his divinity made, nor in his humanity created earlier, but he who, before me and before every person, is first in dignity.

Remember here that Christ in his divinity is not made, and that as man he was made after Saint John, and yet in dignity he is made the very first. And this dignity John confesses when he says: “I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal.” As if he said: “What wonder is it that he is more worthy than I, he whom I know to have been born after me, when I do not fully know the mystery of his birth?” So says St Gregory, In Om. And thus by the strap by which the sandal is fastened to the foot we are to understand the union of Christ’s humanity with the divinity; for the Son of God took humanity to himself in the likeness that, just as the foot comes first and, remaining a foot, takes a sandal upon itself and is hidden beneath the sandal, so the divinity in the person of the Son of God took humanity to itself, and remained divinity, hidden from bodily eyes under humanity. And John is not worthy to untie this union of the divinity with the humanity, as he says, humbly confessing his ignorance in this: “I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal.”

From this saying the black-robed brothers, the monks, argue against the barefoot friars that Christ went about in shoes as they do, saying that John would not have spoken of his sandal if he had none. And the barefoot friars, on the other side, say against them that Christ went about barefoot as they do, for otherwise at the feast Mary Magdalene could not have washed his feet with her tears. But in this quarrel neither side has a good argument; rather, sin remains with both of them, in that they do not wish to follow Christ poor and without desire for riches, and thus, having an excessive desire for wealth, both parties go unshod in spirit. But Christ, who for their sake accepted poverty, was shod in his mind against all desire for earthly riches, and if he pleased, then sometimes he went in sandals and sometimes barefoot. And I do not dare to untie this question, whether he ever walked in shoes, or whether he never walked in them; it is enough for me that for me, a sinner, he walked upon this earth, as he deigned to do.
