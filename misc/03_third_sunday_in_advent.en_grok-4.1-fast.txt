### Third Reading  
**Reading for the Third Sunday of Advent**  
*St. Matthew, chapter 11, verses 2–10.*  

At that time, when John heard in prison about the deeds of Christ, he sent two of his disciples to him (Jesus), saying: “Are you the one who is to come [to redeem us], or should we wait for another?” And Jesus answered and said to them [John’s disciples]: “As you go, tell John the things you have heard and seen: the blind see [being healed], the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached to them [evangelized, that is: they hear God’s word and are edified by it]; and blessed is the one [that is] who takes no offense [does not disbelieve] in me.” And as they departed, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed blown by the wind [that is, no mere man shaken by pride or inconstancy]? And what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft [garments]? Behold, those who wear soft [garments] are in the houses of kings [like the proud and pleasure-seekers]. And what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one of whom it is written [the prophet Malachi writes in chapter 3, verse 1]: ‘Behold, I send my angel [that is, messenger: *angelus* in Greek, *posel* in Czech] before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’”  

This reading mentions the imprisonment of Saint John, the baptizer of Christ; second, the wondrous deeds of the Lord Jesus Christ; third,  
**A.** the praise of Saint John.  

On the imprisonment, the reading says: “When John heard in prison the deeds of Christ.” Note well that St. John was in chains in prison because he had rebuked King Herod for adultery, as St. Matthew writes in chapter 14, verses 3–4: “Herod had seized John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother’s wife; for John had said to him: ‘It is not lawful for you to have her.’” And St. Mark says in chapter 6, verse 20: “Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man; he protected him, and when he heard him, he did many things, and he listened to him gladly.” Why? As St. John Chrysostom says in his sermon on St. John: John the Baptist spoke what belonged to the law, to righteousness, to salvation; he certainly spoke what was not to be hated but loved. Again: “John admonished Herod with holy counsels, not with complaints, as one who loved his soul and desired that he be saved, not damned.” But since it is hard for anyone to give up adultery, Herod refused to abandon his adultery and his adulterous mistress; instead, he chained John and threw him into prison. And while in chains, hearing of Christ’s deeds, he sent his disciples to him. Thus the reading says: “When John heard in prison the deeds of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, saying to him: ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we wait for another?’”  

Note well that holy John did not doubt whether Christ was the one who had come to take away the sins of the world—for he had already confessed it, saying in John 1:29: “Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” He had recognized him even in his mother’s womb and rejoiced; and when he baptized him, he heard the testimony from God the Father that he was his beloved Son, whom we must obey. But holy John inquired out of care for his disciples and other people, so that they would not doubt Christ but believe in him, obey him, and finally follow him. And so he instructed his disciples to ask Christ, saying: “Are you the one who is to come as the promised Redeemer, or should we wait for another?”  

And the reading continues: “And Jesus answered and said to them: ‘As you go, tell John the things you have heard and seen’”—for as St. Luke writes in chapter 7, verse 21, at that very hour he healed many from diseases, plagues, and evil spirits, and gave sight to many blind. And answering, he said to them: “Go and tell John the things you have heard preached and seen in wondrous deeds.” Here St. Ambrose says: “The Lord answers more gladly with his deeds than with words.” And St. Jerome says: “Let words be silent; let deeds speak.” And so our merciful Savior gave this teaching—not to John, but to his disciples—that they might believe he was the one they awaited, who would take away sin and free from damnation. And to show that he was the one, after healing many, he said: “The blind see,” and so on.  

**B.** Note well that the blind represent those who sin from ignorance; the lame, those who live sometimes evilly, sometimes well; the lepers, those who sin from excessive desire; the deaf, those hardened in wickedness; the dead, those who sin from long habit. And all these now, by the grace of our Savior, can be healed—and many already have been—so that those who sinned from ignorance now see, knowing what sin is and how they were blinded by it; then the lame, who lived sometimes evilly, sometimes well, now live steadily in goodness; the lepers, defiled by sin from desire, are now clean; the deaf, who were heedless of God’s word, now listen to it gladly; the dead—that is, those who died in mortal sin in their souls and sinned from habit—now rise from that habit. And in these five spiritual matters there is a greater wonder than in bodily healings, and God’s grace is greater there than in those. Then our dear Savior added a sixth wonder, saying: “The poor have the gospel preached to them”—in Latin *evangelisantur*, that is: they receive the reading, which is God’s word, and so are edified both for themselves and others, hearing it themselves and teaching it to others.  

“The poor”—understand those humble in spirit—are edified by God’s word.  

**C.** Note well that by the preaching of God’s word, the mind is enlightened, unruly desire is set right, evil desire is quenched, hardness in sin is broken, sin is driven out, and God’s grace bears fruit in a person. From this, know that whoever, hearing God’s word, experiences none of these six benefits in himself has a sign that he has listened to God’s word unprofitably.  

On the blessing of the poor in spirit, to whom the Savior was sent to preach—as he himself says through Isaiah 61:1–2 (Luke 4:18–19): “He has sent me to preach good news to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”  

**D.** Further, the Savior says in the reading: “And blessed is the one who takes no offense in me!” Note well that people take offense in Christ in various ways. Some over his mercy, saying he neither avenges when he should, nor fails to avenge when he shouldn’t. On the first, as Habakkuk says in chapter 1, verse 13: “Why do you look on those who do evil?”—that is, why do you not punish? On the second, that lazy servant said in Matthew 25:24: “I knew you were a hard man!” Some take offense at his wisdom, thinking he does things he shouldn’t; like those who curse the weather, or those who think they could devise better than God has done. And so they wonder why evil people prosper, saying Jeremiah’s words in chapter 12:1: “Why does the way of the wicked prosper?”—know why things go well for the wicked? Some take offense at having to suffer with him, as his disciples did, to whom he said in Matthew 26:31: “You will all be offended because of me!” Some take offense at his poverty, like the priests generally, who refuse to be poor willingly; so that young man was offended and went away sorrowful when he told him in Matthew 19:21: “Go, sell what you have, give to the poor, and follow me.” Some take offense at his words, saying with the Jews in John 6:60: “This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?” And thus all take offense who do not keep his commandments, thinking them too hard. In general, whoever does not believe in him or fulfill what he commanded takes offense at Christ. Therefore blessed is the one who is not finally offended by him—for though many were offended, they afterward returned and, by his grace, improved.  

**E.** Then the reading says: “And as they departed, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: ‘What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed blown by the wind?’”—as if to say: Do you think John is like an empty reed inside, lacking God’s grace? Do you suppose flattery sways him, that he sent to me? Or inconstancy, that he first bore witness to me, saying in John 1:29: “Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world,” and now says: “Are you the one, or another?” Know that he did not waver from his testimony, as a reed bends before the wind. Here St. Gregory says: “Reeds at once bend to one side when the wind touches them.” And what does the reed signify? Bodily desire, which, when touched by favor or rebuke, at once swerves aside. If the breeze of favor blows, it rejoices, boasts, and turns wholly toward favor; but if the breeze of rebuke comes from where the wind of praise blew before, it at once turns to anger. But John was no reed blown by the wind—for neither the favor of praise made him a flatterer, nor anyone’s anger made him cruel; neither frequent successes lifted him to pride, nor adversities humbled him from virtue. Thus he was no reed blown by the wind, unmoved from the steadfastness of his state by any thing. Therefore, dearest ones, let us learn not to be reeds blown by the wind: let us fix our intention amid the winds of tongues, let the state of our mind stand unmoved, let no rebuke stir us to anger, let no worthless favor bow us to flattery, let no adversities—like poverty or other things—move us to impatience. Thus we who are established in the constancy of faith will not be moved by the inconstant things of this world. So says St. Gregory.  

In short: let neither flattery move you to pride, nor rebukes to anger, nor successes to the sin of pride or pleasure, nor adversities—like poverty or other things—to impatience. If you stand so, then you will not be a reed blown by the wind, and you will be worthy for Christ to praise you, as he praised St. John.  

**F.** Further, Christ says: “And what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments?”—as if to say: John is no flatterer; for if he wanted to flatter, he would not have lived in the wilderness or sat in rough clothes while in Herod’s prison. If he wanted to flatter, he would flatter kings, not me the poor one—for those who want soft and fine clothes are in the houses of kings and flatter there. Oh, how many flatterers there are, especially priests at princely, royal, and noble courts—and especially at the papal court! To it the greatest flatterers creep, praying and bowing more than to the Lord God. And they do all this to walk in soft robes and finery, to foster pride, pleasure, and greed! How far they have strayed from John’s life! And woe to us who will not suffer, who live softly and yet want to be saved! Woe to those who wear proud garments for show, who trim them fancily, who have so many that moths consume more than they do! St. James the apostle rebukes them, saying in chapter 5, verses 1–3: “Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you. Your riches have rotted, your garments are moth-eaten, your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire!”  

Wise people, remembering this, do not multiply expensive garments for themselves; but they use them just enough to cover shame, ward off cold, and meet the body’s needs. For that is why God gave garments to Eve and Adam after they sinned: leaves to cover their shame, and skins to protect from cold. Behold, John had his rough garment, which equally drove away both shame and cold; therefore the Savior praises him that he did not walk in soft robes.  

Further the reading says: “And what did you go out to see? A prophet?”—as if to say that John was not silent from envy, as if he wanted to be called greater than me, a prophet. Therefore: “Yes, I tell you, he is more than any prophet—for he is the one of whom it is written: ‘Behold, I send my angel before your face.’” These are the words of God the Father to his Son; for God the Father sent John before Christ his Son, so that he would preach first, baptize first, die first for preaching, and thus prepare the way for the people to know and believe in Christ. Therefore he said to the priests of Jerusalem in John 1:26–27: “I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know: he who comes after me, who was before me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.” And so John was sent by God to preach first before Christ as man, baptize first, and prepare the way for the people; and that way is Christ’s way, by which he came after John to baptize us, take away our sins, and finally— if we are good—give us eternal life by his grace.
