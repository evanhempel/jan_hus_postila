So far I like GPT-5.1 and Gemini-3-pro tranlations best. 
Google Doc translation and Google translate are very similar (and probably more exact but less readable), but I don't like as much as the 1st two. Grok reads well but isn't as close to source so I rate it 2nd tier
DeepL is probably best translation from literal standpoint and preserving bad formatting like unmatched braces, but doesn't read great as modern English

Per Grok the Czech text in the hus_postilla.md / hus_postilla.html is inferior to the texttopdf output of hus_postilla.txt (issues with combined characters).
