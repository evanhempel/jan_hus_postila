Here is a translation of Jan Hus’s sermon for the Third Sunday in Advent. I have rendered the 15th-century Czech into fluid, modern English suitable for spoken delivery, while maintaining the theological precision and the direct, spirited tone of a preacher addressing his congregation.

**Reading 3**
**THE READING FOR THE THIRD SUNDAY IN ADVENT**
**St. Matthew, Chapter 11, Verses 2-10.**

At that time, when John had heard in prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, and said to Him: "Are You the One who is to come [to redeem us], or do we look for another?"

Jesus answered and said to them: "Go and tell John again those things which you hear and see: The blind receive their sight [being healed], the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them [that is: they hear the Word of God and profit by it]. And blessed is he who shall not be offended in Me."

And as they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? [Meaning: he is not a man shaken by pride or fickleness]. But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? [Yet he walks in rough camel hair]. Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses [living in pride and luxury]. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet. For this is he of whom it is written [Malachi 3:1]: 'Behold, I send My messenger [angelus in Greek, messenger in English] before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.'"

**The Sermon**

In this reading, there is mention of three things: First, the imprisonment of Saint John, Christ’s baptizer; second, the miraculous works of the Lord Jesus Christ; and third, the praise of Saint John.

**A. Regarding the Imprisonment**
The text says: *"When John had heard in prison the works of Christ."* Here you must know that Saint John was in chains in a dungeon because he rebuked King Herod for adultery. As St. Matthew writes in Chapter 14: "Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother’s wife." For John had told him: "It is not lawful for you to have her." And St. Mark says in Chapter 6 that Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man; he protected him, listened to him, did many things because of him, and heard him gladly.

Why? St. John Chrysostom answers this in a sermon on John the Baptist: "John preached what belonged to the Law, what belonged to justice, and what belonged to salvation; surely he spoke not out of hatred, but out of love." He says further: "John admonished Herod with holy warnings, not with accusations; he spoke as a lover of chastity, wishing for him to be saved, not damned." But because it is difficult for a person to give up sexual sin, Herod—unwilling to cease his adultery and abandon the adulteress—chained John and threw him in prison.

So, while he was in chains, having heard of Christ’s works, he sent his disciples to Him. The reading says: *"He sent two of his disciples, and said to Him: Are You the One who is to come, or do we look for another?"*

Now, understand this: Saint John did not doubt whether Christ was the one who had come to take away the sins of the world. After all, he had already confessed it, saying in John 1:29: "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" He recognized Him while still in his mother’s womb and leaped for joy; and when he baptized Him, he heard the witness of God the Father that this was His beloved Son whom we must obey.

Rather, Saint John asked this question out of concern for his disciples and other people, so that *they* would not doubt Christ, but believe in Him, obey Him, and finally follow Him. That is why he ordered his disciples to ask Christ: "Are You the One who is to come as the promised Redeemer, or do we wait for another?"

**B. Regarding the Miracles**
The text continues: *"Jesus answered and said to them: Go and tell John again those things which you hear and see."* For as St. Luke writes (7:21), in that very hour He cured many of infirmities, afflictions, and evil spirits; and to many blind He gave sight. He told them: "Go and report to John what you have heard in my preaching and seen in my miraculous deeds."

St. Ambrose notes here: "The Lord answers with deeds rather than words." And St. Jerome says: "Let words be silent; let works speak." Thus, our gracious Savior gave a lesson not to John, but to his disciples, so they would believe He was the one they had been waiting for—the one to take away sins and deliver them from damnation.

To prove He is that One, He heals many and says: *"The blind see,"* and so on. Here, understand the spiritual meaning:
*   **The Blind** represent those who sin out of ignorance;
*   **The Lame** are those who do evil one moment and good the next;
*   **The Lepers** are those who sin out of great lust;
*   **The Deaf** are those hardened in malice;
*   **The Dead** are those who sin out of ingrained habit.

All of these can now be healed by the grace of our Savior, and many are already healed. Those who sinned in ignorance now see, realizing what sin is and how blind they were. The lame, who lived inconsistently, now live consistently well. The lepers, defiled by the filth of desire, are now clean. The deaf, who disregarded God’s Word, now listen gladly. And the dead—those who were dead in their souls through mortal sin and sinned out of habit—now rise from that habit.

There is a greater miracle in these five spiritual healings than in physical ones, and greater grace is shown. Then the dear Savior adds a sixth miracle: *"The poor have the gospel preached to them"* (in Latin: *evangelisantur*). This means they receive the Word of God, profiting themselves and teaching others. By "poor," understand the **humble in spirit**; these are the ones who prosper by God's Word.

**C. Regarding the Power of the Word**
Know this: through the preaching of God's Word, the mind is enlightened, desire is corrected, evil lust is extinguished, hardness in malice is broken, sin is driven out, and God's grace is born in a person. Therefore, know that if anyone hears the Word of God and feels none of these six benefits, it is a sign that he is listening in vain.

Oh, blessed are the poor in spirit to whom the Savior was sent to preach! As He says through Isaiah (61:1): "The Lord has anointed Me to preach good tidings to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound."

**D. Regarding Offense**
The Savior continues: *"And blessed is he who shall not be offended in Me!"*

Understand that people take offense at Christ in various ways:
*   Some are offended at **His mercy**, saying He does not punish when He should, or punishes when He shouldn't. As Habakkuk says (1:13): "Why do You look on those who deal treacherously, and hold Your tongue when the wicked devours?"
*   Some are offended at **His wisdom**, thinking He does things He ought not to do—like those who curse the weather, or those who think they could plan things better than God did. They marvel that evil people prosper, echoing Jeremiah (12:1): "Why does the way of the wicked prosper?"
*   Some are offended because **they do not want to suffer with Him**, just as His disciples were offended when He told them: "All of you will be offended because of Me this night" (Matt 26:31).
*   Some are offended at **His poverty**—this is common among priests who refuse to be voluntarily poor. The young man in the Gospel was offended this way; he went away sorrowful when Christ told him: "Go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and come, follow Me."
*   Some are offended at **His speech**, saying with the Jews in John 6: "This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?"

In short, everyone is offended who does not keep His commandments because they think they are too heavy. Generally, anyone who does not believe in Him or fails to do what He commanded takes offense at Christ. Therefore, truly blessed is the one who is not scandalized by Him to the end. For even if many have stumbled, if they return, they are corrected by His grace.

**E. Regarding the Reed**
Then the text says: *"And as they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?"*

It is as if He said: "Do you think John is like a hollow reed, empty inside, having no grace of God? Do you think he is shaken by flattery (because he sent a message to Me) or by fickleness (because he previously bore witness to Me, saying 'Behold the Lamb of God,' and now asks 'Are You the One?')? Know that he has not moved from his testimony like a reed before the wind."

St. Gregory speaks on this: "As soon as the wind touches a reed, it bends aside. And what is meant by the reed? The carnal mind. As soon as praise or slander touches it, it bends. If the breeze of favor blows, it rejoices and bends toward favor; but if the wind of slander blows from the other direction, it immediately bends toward anger."

But John was not a reed shaken by the wind. The favor of praise did not make him a flatterer, nor did anyone’s anger make him cruel. Prosperity did not lift him up in pride, nor did adversity cast him down from virtue. Therefore, let us learn, dearest ones, not to be reeds shaken by the wind! Let us firm up our minds amidst the winds of tonguewagging. Let the state of our mind stand immovable. Let no slander provoke us to anger, and let no fickle favor bend us. Let us, who are established in the constancy of faith, not be moved by the inconstant things of this world.

Briefly understand: Do not let yourself be moved by flattery into pride, nor by slander into anger, nor by prosperity into the sin of arrogance or luxury, nor by adversity—such as poverty—into impatience. If you stand thus, you will not be a reed shaken by the wind, and you will be worthy of Christ’s praise, just as He praised Saint John.

**F. Regarding Soft Clothing**
Christ continues: *"But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?"*

As if to say: John is no flatterer. If he wanted to flatter, he would not have lived in the wilderness, nor sat in rough skins in Herod’s dungeon. If he wanted to flatter, he would flatter kings, not Me, a poor man. For those who wish to walk in soft and beautiful clothes are in kings' houses—and they flatter.

Oh, how many of these flatterers there are! Especially priests at the courts of princes, kings, and lords—and most especially at the court of the Pope! That is where the greatest flatterers crawl; they pray and bow to him more than to the Lord God. And they do all this just to walk in soft cloth and expensive robes, breeding pride, luxury, and greed!

Surely, these people have wandered far from John’s life! Woe to us who do not want to suffer, who live easily yet expect to be saved! Woe to those who wear proud clothing for boasting, who cut it in strange fashions, who own so much of it that the moths eat more of it than they do! St. James the Apostle attacks them, saying (5:1-3): "Weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you! Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire!"

Wise people, remembering this, do not multiply expensive clothes for themselves. They use clothing only as is proper to cover shame, drive away the cold, and serve the body’s needs. For God gave clothing to Adam and Eve for these reasons after they sinned; He gave them skins to cover their shame and protect against the cold. behold, John wore a rough coat and repelled both shame and cold equally; therefore, the Savior praises him for not walking in soft raiment.

**Conclusion**
Finally, the reading asks: *"But what did you go out to see? A prophet?"* As if to say, John does not remain silent out of envy, wishing to be called a prophet above Me. Therefore: *"Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet. For this is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send My messenger before Your face."*

This is the speech of God the Father to the Son. The Father sent John before Christ, His Son, so that John would preach first, baptize first, and die for his preaching first. In this way, he prepared the road for the people to recognize Christ and believe in Him.

This is why John told the priests of Jerusalem (John 1:26): "I baptize with water, but there stands One among you whom you do not know. It is He who, coming after me, is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose."

So John was sent by God to preach and baptize before Christ the man, to prepare the way for the people. And that way is the Way of Christ, which He walked after John, so that He might baptize us, rid us of sins, and finally—if we are good—give us eternal life by His grace.
