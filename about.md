## About This Project

This repository contains the full text of **Magister Jan Hus's *Česká nedělní postila*** (Czech Sunday Postil), a collection of approximately 60 sermons on the Sunday Gospel readings for the liturgical year. Written in Czech during Hus's exile in 1412–1413 and drawing directly from his famous vernacular preaching at Bethlehem Chapel in Prague, the Postil is one of the most important works of early Reformation-era theology in the language of the people.

Until now, no complete English translation of the Postil has been publicly available — only scattered excerpts appear in scholarly works. This project aims to change that by providing:

- Clean, searchable Czech texts of each sermon (based on this edition: https://lide.cb.cz/pavel.mosner/hus/kazani/hus_postila.pdf)
- Accurate, readable English translations designed to be spoken aloud
- Clear formatting suitable for personal study, church reading, or public performance

### Primary Goal
To supply the wonderful podcast **Revived Thoughts** (revivedthoughts.com) with ready-to-record scripts of Jan Hus's sermons. Revived Thoughts "resurrects" historic Christian sermons by giving a brief biography of the preacher and then dramatizing the sermon itself — bringing the wisdom of the past to modern listeners. Hus, as a direct forerunner of the Reformation who preached Scripture and reform in the vernacular a century before Luther, is a perfect fit for the show.

### Broader Purpose
Beyond the podcast, these translations are freely offered for anyone who wants to read, study, teach, or share Hus's powerful preaching:

- Pastors and churches looking for historic sermon material
- Students of church history and the Bohemian Reformation
- Anyone interested in the roots of Protestant thought

To the extent possible all files are released into the public domain (or under CC0) so they may be used, adapted, and distributed without restriction.  The PDF I found (link above) did not have any copyright restriction so far as I could tell.

### Current Status
- All original Czech sermons are complete and available (in the github repo, but maybe not on this site).
- English translations are in progress (several are finished using the latest AI models for highest accuracy).
- New translations will be added regularly.

Contributions, corrections, and suggestions are welcome! If you spot an improvement or would like to help refine the translations, please open an issue or pull request.
