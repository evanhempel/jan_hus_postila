Translate this 15th-century Czech sermon by Jan Hus into natural, readable
modern English while preserving the preaching tone and biblical quotations.
Keep it literal where doctrine matters, but make it flow as if spoken aloud
today.

If he uses Latin, Greek, or Hebrew within his Czech sermon render it as-is and
do not translate into English.

When scripture is quoted translate it from Czech into English, do not attempt
to substitute an existing English translation.
