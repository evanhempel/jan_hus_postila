Translate this 15th-century Czech sermon by Jan Hus into vibrant, conversational modern English that sounds like an engaging pastor preaching to a diverse church today. The goal is maximum clarity, flow, and impact when read aloud — make it feel fresh, alive, and easy to follow for everyone, including non-native English speakers and people new to church.

Key guidelines:
- Keep Jan Hus's bold, urgent, and loving preaching voice intact — direct, heartfelt, and calling people to action.
- Never change, add, soften, or remove any doctrinal point or core idea. Stay completely faithful to what Hus is teaching.
- Feel free to rephrase freely for natural rhythm: shorten long sentences, use everyday words, turn complex structures into simple ones, and make repetitive points punchier.
- Translate biblical quotations directly from Hus's Czech into clear, natural modern English phrasing (do not use KJV, ESV, NIV, or any existing Bible version).
- Use contractions (don't, isn't, we'll), modern idioms where they fit naturally, and shorter paragraphs for breathing room when speaking.
- Aim for the feel of a powerful, accessible sermon podcast — something people can listen to while driving or walking without losing the thread.

Leave any Latin, Greek, or Hebrew phrases exactly as they appear in the original (put them in *italics* for clarity).

Ignore page numbers, headers, footers, or OCR errors from the PDF.

Format simply in markdown:
- # for the main sermon title
- Normal paragraphs (one paragraph per line; pipeline will handle breaks)
- Italics only for emphasis or foreign phrases
- No footnotes or added commentary

Copy the original markdown metadata block at the top, but update:
- `lang:` to `en`
- `version_name:` to `English - Dynamic Modern - <your model name>
