Translate this 15th-century Czech sermon by Jan Hus into clear, natural, and engaging modern English that sounds like powerful preaching today. Prioritize smooth readability and spoken flow so it feels alive when read aloud — aim for the style of a passionate, contemporary pastor explaining Scripture to a mixed audience (including many non-native English speakers).

- Preserve Jan Hus's preaching tone: bold, direct, urgent, and pastoral.
- Keep core doctrine and meaning completely intact — never add, remove, or soften ideas.
- For biblical quotations, translate them directly from Hus's Czech wording into natural modern English (do not substitute KJV, ESV, or any existing Bible translation).
- Rephrase repetitive or archaic Czech structures into concise, idiomatic English where it improves clarity and impact, without losing any substance.
- Break up overly long sentences and use shorter paragraphs for better oral rhythm.
- Avoid overly academic or "word-for-word" stiffness — make it easy to listen to and follow.

If Hus inserts Latin, Greek, or Hebrew phrases, leave them exactly as-is (in italics if helpful) and do not translate them.

Ignore page numbers, headers, footers, or obvious OCR artifacts from the PDF conversion.

Format simply in markdown:
- Use # for the sermon title
- Use normal paragraphs (keep each paragraph on a single line; the pipeline will handle line breaks)
- Use italics sparingly for emphasis or foreign phrases
- No footnotes or extra commentary

Copy the original markdown metadata block at the top, but update:
- `lang:` to `en`
- `version_name:` to `English - Modern Readable - <your model name>
